A quick note on Sam Harris' The End of Faith. Harris excoriates religion (most
of his points I agree with), and then sees, rightly, that what follows froma
large scale rejection of historic religion as thebasis for morality is a
conceptual hole that will need to be filled. His answer: scientific realism
about ethics. Not sure how persuasive he is defending _sr_ &mdash;the task,
once it becomes philosophical, becomes correspondingly difficult
anyway&mdash;but certainly I agree with him that some ethical intuitions we
(mostly) all share. What we need is a framework within which to apply the
intuitions. More specifically:

1. Identify the most universal ethical intuitions. These are the cross cultural
beliefs about rightness and wrongness. (Call these "top tier" or "first order"
ethical intuitions?).

2. Set up a system whereby our justification for acting is a function of how
directly these ethical intuitions can undewrite the actions. So we're really off
the scales when arguing for waging a war against infidels by the killing of
innocents. But, with something like a first trimester abortion, the universal
ethical intuitions aren't doing as much work. (The easiest way to see this is
that reasonable people still, manifestly, disagree.) Our tolerance then for
opposing views ought to be higher&mdash; _in principle_ higher&mdash;given the
murkier epistemic waters we're now swimming. And, oh, of course: the Golden Rule
fares quite well in this admittedly hasty scheme I've sketched.
