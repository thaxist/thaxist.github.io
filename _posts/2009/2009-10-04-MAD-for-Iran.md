We can say: "Don't let 'um have nukes" is the West's current strategy with
regard to Iran. But what about: "Give 'um all nukes"? Is there a mutual assured
destruction model for the Middle East? Suppose Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Yeman, Oman, Kuwait, et cetera all had nukes (say, by redirecting the West's
money and time away from detection and protection towards some distribution of
nuclear capabilities for all Middle East countries). Now, for example, Iraq
can't just go "tribal" on Kuwait, storming in with conventional forces like in
the Gulf War. It faces _nuclear_ retaliation. And so on for other conflicts
with other countries. The Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) model has kept the
rest of the world out of catastrophe since the beginnings of the Cold War. Why
not in the Middle East? Do we really think the leaders of these countries would
be quick to fire nuclear weapons at each other, thus extinguishing vast
populations of people, poisioning there own lands for generations to come, and
in general bringing any possibility of progress or reconciliation to a
screeching halt? Or, would some group of Muslim-countries point their newly
minted nuclear missles at the hated Jew-country? Would Israel adopt the policy
of pre-emptive strike? Would MAD
fail?
