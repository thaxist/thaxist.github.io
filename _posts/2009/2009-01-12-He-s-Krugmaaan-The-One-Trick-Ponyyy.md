[Paul
Krugman](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html)
, Nobel Prize winner, Princeton economics professor, and New York Times luminary
has _a theme_ for writing columns lately in the NYT, and I would hope that most
people with a reasonable IQ can ascertain it by now: _make Obama's fiscal
stimulus package larger_ . Yes, that's it. And today he 
[re-iterated](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/opinion/12krugman.html) his
reiterations by adding this "meat" on the thematic bone: drop the tax cuts,
increase benefits for the unemployed, and ramp up the Keynesian "infastructure"
projects. [More](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/opinion/07krugman.html?_r=1)

[more](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/opinion/14krugman.html) . Otherwise, he
warns, we might not get the benefit from the fiscal stimulus (just like FDR, he
assures us, who didn't go far enough with the New Deal).

To my lights, Paul Krugman has the flavor of a guy who wants to see his academic
work tested in the field of battle. He's an ideologue. And what Krugman wants,
ideologically, is to see a really, really big Keynsian project make _all the
difference_ . He wants to be exonerated for being (more and more it seems)
entrenched in his academic position, a position which it's fair to say is
decidedly unlike the recent pragmatism shown by President-elect Obama. Krugman
wants to see _pure theory_ played out in practice. And the Credit Crisis is
his BIG CHANCE. Well, he might after all be right. But I have to confess that
I've been systematically unconvinced by his slew of same-sounding columns in the
Times. It might behoove Mr. Krugman, even with that Nobel Prize, to dig a little
deeper to help us understand why, exactly, spending _trillions_ right now is
exactly what we need to do. Convince us. I mean, don't _assert_ it, give us
reasons. Why, for instance, should we jettison Mr. Obama's proposal to cut taxes
on small businesses and instead pump massive amounts of tax payer money into
selected government projects? Why, for instance, should we crank out tax payer
dollars for causes like "enhanced unemployment benefits" with the aim of getting
the economy moving again? How does this happen?

To be sure, Mr. Krugman's assertions thus far all sound grand, from a "social
justice" point of view. No argument here. But &mdash; talking about stimulating
the actual economy &mdash; I'm a little less clear how the types of spending
packages promulgated by Krugman translate into getting the _**Business Engine**_
 started again in America. Confusing, perhaps, since stimulating the economy is
precisely what he claims to be discussing. Maybe Mr. Krugman's next column will
reveal all. (On second thought, don't count on it. But do count on another
column making _exactly the same point.)_ 

At any rate I won't stop reading Mr. Krugman, no way. It's a great deal:
editorial after editorial with the same message, and hardly a detailed argument
in any of them (suggests a little _argumentum ad verecundiam_ perhaps _),_ 
along with a full-stop endorsement of any and all government spending projects.
Well, he makes me a True Believer, in a sceptical non-believing sort of way. The
Nobel Prize must be worth
something.
