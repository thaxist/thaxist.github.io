European leaders are balking at Keynesian stimulus, to the degree that Obama has
backed off his original plan to push this at the upcoming G20 sumit.

Did I miss something? In this country, the Neanderthal Republicans are sceptical
of Keynesian stimulus, and Democrats &mdash; especially liberal Democrats
&mdash; apparently think it's settled that it works and that nothing else in
times of recession will. Forget inflation, stagflation, or any other bugaboo. If
you're a liberal Democrat, this Keynesian spending stuff works.

So, what's wrong with Europe? Why aren't they buying fiscal stimulus? _Really_ 
not buying it. Czech Prime Minister Topolanek called more spending right now
"the road to hell". French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel have
explicitly rejected Obama's call for more global spending. Their position is
clear enough:

"...the problem is not about spending more, but putting in place a system of
regulation so that the economic and financial catastrophe that the world is
seeing does not reproduce itself."

What are these European leaders, closet Capitalists? Sheesh. I wonder what Paul
if-only-we-could-spend-even-more Krugman thinks of the Continent now.
Neanderthals.
