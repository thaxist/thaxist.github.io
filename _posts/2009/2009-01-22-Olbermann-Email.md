The email I sent to MSNBC below. It's based on an exchange from a prior post. In
this exchange, there was consistency. But I think Mr. Olbermann is in much more
of a pickle, if he keeps on his present track:

"

I watch with interest Countdown with Keith Olbermann. I'm confused however about
Mr. Olbermann's Special Comment on the eve of the inauguration of President
Obama, where he makes an impassioned, forceful case that "Bush is guilty of
torture" and ought to be investigated and perhaps tried and found guilty, in
spite of President Obama's public statements to the contrary. President Obama,
for his part, just wants to "move on". This profound disagreement between Mr.
Olbermann and President Obama is particularly puzzling since, otherwise, Mr.
Olbermann speaks quite positively and even glowingly about our new President.

So, my question to Mr. Olbermann is: If President Obama _does not wish_ to
investigate possible "war crimes" committed by the former Bush Administration,
and if it's _so clear cut_ that such acts were in fact committed, what does
this say about President Obama?

We can assume that President Obama must have the relevant facts at his disposal.
So, following simple logic, should Mr. Olbermann conclude that President Obama
is just weak, or rather is he morally suspect? This question Mr. Olbermann ought
to answer directly. Otherwise, he seems to be talking "out of both sides of his
mouth" as they say, and his many viewers ought to call him on it.

Thanks,

Erik
