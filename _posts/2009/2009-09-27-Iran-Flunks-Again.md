Why does Iran want a [nuclear
capability](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/26/AR2009092601359.html)
? Is it at all plausible that it's _not_ for weaponry? No. It's safe to
conclude that their nuclear ambitions are militaristic (what fantastic
self-deception would convince a thinking person otherwise?). So, then, why does
Iran want _nuclear weapons_ ? To defend against what threat? Israel? Israel is
armed to the teeth, including a [nuclear
arsenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction)
capable of disintegrating Iran in a cloud of U-235, and hasn't used them to
invade or to advance against Iran in spite of constant, hostile threats from the
latter. It's pure fiction &mdash; a kind of delusional, racist, Middle Age
cogitation emitted by the Iranian clerics and kept endlessly circulating among
its people &mdash; that Israel poses some grave offensive threat. What's less
fictional are unending remarks by that smiling buffoon Ahmadinejad that the
solution to the Middle East crisis is to "destroy Israel".

The West is understandably paternalistic toward Iran and other shit-bag places
where rational thought, a respect for historical accuracy, and the pursuit of
lofty ideals like knowledge and science are in scarce supply, and subjugated to
radicalized religious rhetoric. What's the alternative for the West? Ignore
mountains of clear evidence to the contrary and insist on including them in the
self-interested but ultimately rational dialogue that developed nations enjoy? 
That's a Peter Pan foreign policy. It's easiest, safest, and entirely justified
in the interest of global and regional stability to just pester the hell out of
their regime with paternalistic demands, sanctions, remonstrations, threats, and
even if necessary military actions. As long as it keeps their religious-fueled
racist craziness toward Israel and the West from taking form in physical
weaponry &mdash; making it possible to transform words into actions &mdash; it's
a paternalism we ought to embrace. So: those damn Iranian leaders, they act like
children, cussing and threatening their neighbors, and never doing their science
homework, or getting their history lessons straight. This fanatical ignoramus of
a regime must be punished! Punished!
Punished!
