We're getting snookered. This is bad. Who remembers the "Troubled Assets
Relief Program" (TARP), 700 billion in spending approved just months ago? Well,
that's not interesting anymore. Silence on TARP. Now another 800 billion from
the latest American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill. This will work!

TARP was supposed to right the ship. That's how it was sold, to the sceptical
public (remember?). And yet, no discussion anymore, nothing. And now a new
bill presumably because we have a new administration (TARP was Bush, and
therefore failed), and it's another 800 billion. What about TARP? Sold to us
in the same way: huge spending necessary to avert disaster. Months later we
can't even remember what happened to the money, or why it was approved. 

In the meantime our debt grows to proportions never seen before, and our elected
officials play these games with the public. Why not, the public has a short
memory...
