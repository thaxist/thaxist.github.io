My wife brought our dog Sam back from the animal shelter Spring of 2006. He was
a sickly puppy at the time, full of worms, with a running eye, and a pensive,
shy demeanor. But he won over my wife, with his tawny fur and big, innocent
eyes. He was Paul when we took him home, and when he reached our house he was
Sam.

Sam's running eye was harmless, according to the vet, and the worms clinging in
his swollen belly were let loose by the pills we embedded in his food. He grew
larger by degrees I'm sure, but as we experienced him his progress was discreet,
so that he was suddenly a larger pup, and then an adolescent, with no stages in
between. Sam took to chewing everything in our back yard, which caused me great
consternation, and prompted ongoing friction between my wife and I, as she
remonstrated me on my lack of patience, and I her on our lack of unpunctured
water hoses, and unchewed bushes, and boards on our deck free of marks from
puppy teething.

Sam was a classic mut, a pound puppy that was listed as a cross between a Pit
Bull and a Labrador, the faintly discernible drops in an ocean of breeds
comprising his motley
origin.
