[Stacking up
bodies](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090121/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_gaza_counting_the_dead)
in Gaza, again. There is no clear path ahead for this damnable conflict. Israel
offers at present no answer. Their thesis is apparently that Hamas can be bombed
into military submission (which it likely can) and then soon after into changes
in politics (which it can't). And so the bodies keep piling up. What the First
World fails to understand about this perpetual bloodbath is that it is, at root,
a _religious war_ .

It is true that the Israeli response is heavy-handed and troublesome (again),
but equally, Hamas is predictably fomenting a constant radicalization of this
conflict at the expense of compromise, an end to violence, and a lasting peace. 
_Victory at all costs_ makes sense when one is confronted with an enemy bent on
global domination, as Churchill well knew and as France surely learned in those
dark hours of the 20th century. But the "kill the Infidels" battle cry of Hamas
given Israel's desire to exist in the region without constant threat of
terrorist attack cannot be excused easily, if at all. It is a Holy War more than
a rational assessment of the conditions for peace. And so the usual carrots
offered by the First World&mdash; money, prospects for a better economy &mdash;
never find purchase with Hamas, and more generally with leaders steeped in
radical Islamic dogma. _To hell with modernity_ makes it difficult to propose
modern solutions.

What to do? Who knows? I do know that the political Left hopes that compromises
and concessions by Israel will have some real effect on the policies of Hamas.
It's hard to see how this will transpire, and history suggests that it's just so
much more wishful thinking . On the Right, this idea that full-scale bombing
campaigns into heavily populated areas will brow-beat Hamas into "coming to the
table" is surely wishful thinking as well. The end Israel will achieve, if any
at all, is just another temporary cessation of violence, while Hamas
re-organizes, and reloads. In the meantime, thousands of innocent people in Gaza
are the unfortunate and truly tragic victims of this damnable
conflict.
