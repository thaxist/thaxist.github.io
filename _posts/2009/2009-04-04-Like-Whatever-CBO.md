The Congressional Budget Office in March released [revised
estimates](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123880278764488701.html) for the cost
to tax payers of the 700 Billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), to 356
Billion from 189 Billion. This quiet piece of news from CBO doesn't even seem
troubling to me anymore, desensitized as I am to seeing billions or trillions
appended to estimates of new government programs these days.

There's a kind of perverse liberation one can get when a situation is so bad
that there's no point worrying about it anymore. Oh, so it's really _356
Billion_ ? Okay, thanks for letting me know. If it goes up again, no need to say
anything. I'll assume it's really bad, and you can spare me the details, okay? 
Cool.

I can't really get my mind around these bills anyway; if I run up a hundred
dollar tab at the Macaroni Grill, I can see that's a lot for a couple hours of
dinner and wine. But 356 Billion? What does this mean? And what can any of us do
about it
anyway?
