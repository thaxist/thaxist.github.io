The New York Times ran an obviously self-referential 
[op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/opinion/28swensen.html) Wednesday on
the demise of newspapers from a steadily increasing Web readership. I read the
NYT and the Wall Street Journal newspapers, and the thought of a world absent
physical newspapers borders on fear. A world without newspapers?

It's understandable that news consumers have turned to digital content; it's
mostly freely available, easy to access, and ubiquitous now that broadband is a
commonplace in American homes and offices. I don't blame the new generation for
turning to the Web for their news fix these days. It makes sense. And
newspapers, like so many other products pulled from the shelves of consumer
markets, are perhaps just the latest victims in the ongoing history of failed
business models. Their readers are the hapless dinosaurs watching the darkening
sky, faintly aware that it signals an end and some new beginning. 

If the newspapers fail &mdash; and many of them are suffering and on the verge
&mdash; we'll have lost something that can't be replaced by so many Web pages. 
For those who know the joy of fetching the morning newspaper, holding in hand
the new day, thumbing through the world of events and information and
commentary, look up. See the sky darkening as unsustainable business models die
their slow but ineluctable deaths. And know also that the paper you hold
retains a value that changing consumer markets does not explain, or
describe.
