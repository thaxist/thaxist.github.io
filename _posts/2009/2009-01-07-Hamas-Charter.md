For those who are _Middle East curious_ , here are some highlights from the
Hamas Charter (it's like their _Constitution_ ...). Following I'll post the
link to the full charter. Read up!

"Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it,
just as it obliterated others before it." 

"The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an
Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It,
or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not
be given up. "

"There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad.
Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and
vain endeavors."

"After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates.
When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to
further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the "Protocols of the
Elders of Zion", and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are
saying."
