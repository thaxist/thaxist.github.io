Everyone knows Code Pink: Women for Peace. Only these dunderheads have no
message. That was proved tonight, watching founder Medea Benjamin explain that
there shouldn't be any troops in Afghanistan. No war is all she could think.
Stupid. The interviewer asked her if she thought life for women in Afghanistan
would be better if we pulled out and let the Taliban reassert themselves. She
can't answer the question. So worked up about war, she can't think about women
for peace. Let's help her. Women under the Taliban: no education, no political
rights, no sexual rights, no life. Code Pink: Women for Peace!

This organization is so bereft of actual practical ideas for how to make the
world better for women that it is astounding that anyone still listens. They're
the Forest Gump of wars: _Bombs are baad._ But what do we do when only the
Taliban has bombs in Afghanistan? Think a few steps ahead, ladies. Stupid is as
stupid says.

We all have figured out by now that there's nothing but oppression, and
violence, and threats to peace, prosperity, and progress if the Taliban takes
over once again in Afghanstan. So, just pull out? Wrong. Code Pink should be
renamed to WHHCW: _Women for Horrible Humiliating Circumstances for Women!_ 
Or, _Women for the Subjugation of Women by Extremist Islamic Men!_ Own it
ladies, own it.

I'm thinking of creating a group for women, to morally trump Code Pink (send
your donations!): _Erik's Keep the Troups in Afghanistan Until We Can Insure
That Women Will Not Be Persecuted Like It's The Middle Ages Once Again_ (sorry,
the acronym is unmanageable). Give your money and time to me! I can do much more
than the dunderheads, and I don't even need to march on the
Capitol.
