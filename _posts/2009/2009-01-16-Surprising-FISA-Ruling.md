It turns out that the Bush Administration's warrantless wiretapping program 
_was_ legal and Constitutional, according to, somewhat surprisingly, [the FISA
appellate court](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123206822799888351.html) in a
just released 2008 ruling . This is quite a ruling, especially coming from FISA.
Not sure I agree, but then I'm not a Constitutional scholar either.

I haven't seen this in the media, come to think of it, and it seems significant,
since what's at issue &mdash; whether the government can spy on its citizens
&mdash; is clearly of major concern to all of us. Someone cover this story! I'd
like to hear some analysis of it from both
sides.
