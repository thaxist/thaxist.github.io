Apparently, the [Antarctica
conundrum](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3D8153AF931A35757C0A9649C8B63)
has been 
[solved](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/science/earth/22climate.html?ref=earth)
. Antarctica is now believed to be uniformly warming, according to Eric J. Steig
at the University of Washington. The new evidence comes from interpolating the
measurements of relatively isolated weather stations using satellite data. Some
of those stations had been recording cooling temperatures, leading to the
hypothesis that Antarctica was cooling in some regions, and warming in others.

I'm skeptical of "interpolation" techniques that run counter to the conclusions
drawn from review of actual physical readings, but I won't be so bold as to
declare this latest twist in the ongoing Global Warming discussion suspect. How
would I know? We'll have to let the experts evaluate the findings over time, and
communicate to us the validity and significance of this latest piece of the
puzzle.

What I will offer, in the meantime, is a "meta" observation about how
discussions about Global Warming typically go, this latest about Antarctica a
prime example: if there _is_ evidence of cooling somewhere (especially at the
poles, which are in general more sensitive to the factors thought to lead to
climate change), GW proponents are quick to invoke language about complexity,
pointing out that we should expect local cooling even when the mean temperature
of the Earth is increasing. When such evidence is debunked, however, or at least
called into question, the GW crowd breathes a collective sigh of relief, and
points to the latest warming as clear evidence for the global warming theory. In
other words, when some Region A is believed to be cooling, it's argued that this
is consistent with Global Warming. And when the science then suggests that
Region A is in fact warming, the new finding then _fixes the prior problem_ 
with Region A appearing to cool. But I thought it wasn't a problem? Such
strategies justifiably encourage a healthy scepticism from the discerning
public, who might begin to wonder what evidence would ever be counted against
the theory by its proponents.

Steig's results were published Thursday in the journal
Nature.
