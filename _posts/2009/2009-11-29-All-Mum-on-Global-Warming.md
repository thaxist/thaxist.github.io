None of my Global Warming enthusiast friends are peeping right now. Hmmm. Maybe
it's because the theory that co2 is driving climate change is slowly but
assuredly unraveling, as all politically backed "scientific" theories do. The
Earth warms, and cools, and warms again. Suddenly our lawnmowers and autos and
jets are the cause. Wow. What an easy target, for a skeptic, like me.

I wish more enthusiasts would go on the record, on this blog, proclaiming the
truth of Global Warming. Later, I'll use the posts to further rub it in. My
point, always, is that science should be free of politics, and it's clear in
this particular debate that pure science in this sense is an obvious illusion.
Time will only make this point stronger.

So, speak up, you Global Warming folks! You're already on record on the blog,
but let's hear
more.
