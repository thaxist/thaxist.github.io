So I've established that the notion of policing other folks on their use of
force extends beyond Iran. I want to broach a new subject.

The subject is Health Care. Launching into this: I'm so disenfranchised with
Republican opposition, in the specific sense that they seem to have generated
nothing more by way of objection than that the plan will be "socialist". But
this misses the point. It's scare tactics. The Obama slash Congress plan is a
distinctively American plan. Unlike other true socialist countries, our health
care reform agenda has been discussed through and through as a _gain to the
economy_ . As an improvement of health care efficiency. As, in other words, a
net _improvement,_ to a predominantly Capitalist society. Better coverage.
Less insurance company abuse. A plan to pay for it by cleaning up wastefulness.
This is selling socialism with capitalist arguments. It's selling more America
to Americans.

Which makes the whole recent "push" for health care reform so quintessentially,
well, American. We'll extend coverage and better the health care system. No one,
really, really, will have to pay for it. Sure, we may nudge up taxes here or
there, and tweak this or that program. But hell, no one will really suffer, not
really, and we'll have a _better system_ to hold up as trump card against
scrutiny. This is America, after all! We're not some sorry European-style
government that has to recede into punitive taxes and a real bleeding of
entreprenurial spirit among its populace, taking care of the sick in a pathetic
charade of dependency masquerading as morality. Hell, no. We'll make health care
better, and make the country better, and by God we'll make America better!

Final thought, if health care is so bad because Insurance Companies control it
(and I hate them, too, like everyone else), why not force health insurance to
compete? John Stossell it, my man. Go the other way. Who ever produced any
statistics to the effect that REAL competition among providers wouldn't fix our
current health care woes? Who is so naive to think that we have REAL competition
now?

But, anyway, my point (again) is that even while proposing to socialize medicine
(as Republicans charge), we're doing it in a way that shows yet again our
superioirity to real socialist countries, a point that seems lost on the
"Hannity" crowd. We're still America. We make, even in Obama land, decidedly
Capitalist arguments for our reforms. Better Health Care, paid for. Efficient.
American. Works better. Runs better. America. America the Beautiful. We're
still aiming to put a man on Mars, by God. Better have a competitive health
care system. Not some grey depression of real
socialism.
