_President_ Barack Hussein Obama. Congratulations! My wife and I watched the
inauguration with the unmistakeable sense of _significance_ , that something
significant was unfolding in front of us. Years from now, people will ask each
other what they were doing on this inauguration day. It's a distinctively
American moment, full of meaning and purpose and emotion that wells up out of
our unique and sometimes painful and even at times tragic past. But always, in
this continuing American narrative, there is an ineradicable optimism, a deep
well of hope for a better tomorrow. This our President Obama expressed in words
today, and symbolized in his person and in the office that he now holds.
Congratulations.
