President Elect Obama [had
dinner](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/obama-dines-with-conservative-columnists/)
at conservative columnist George Will's house, where David Brooks, Charles
Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, Paul Gigot of the WSJ, and other conservative
luminaries accompanied him.

On the cable news yack-and-attack today, Obama's latest "post partisan" move
seemed to prompt some crinkled brows from the likes of Hardball's Chris
I'll-yell-until-you-answer-me Mathews, and Keith Olbermann from Countdown fame
(also an occasional, but pretty good, sports analyst for ESPN).

Olbermann in particular made me chuckle a bit, covering this latest from Obama.
I think he needed more time to digest, actually, because he seemed to be asking
his viewers both "Why didn't _Bush_ do this?" and "Why in the heck did Obama
DO this?". (In other words, meeting with the opposition is good, and why meet
with the opposition?)

Ahh, yes. I think people covering the Hill don't yet know what to make of Mr.
Obama. Pragmatism and a willingness to get past petty partisan quibbles left
Washington long ago. Certainly, President Bush's famous &mdash; now notorious
&mdash; claim to be "a uniter, not a divider" has become the subject of jokes;
Washington is more divided now than ever. I'm hopeful that our new President is
quietly, pragmatically uniting the country with political skill and intelligence
even as the partisans around him continue reading from yesterday's script. He
just might pull it
off.
