No time for an in depth blog tonight, but what's up with AG Eric Holder's
pursuit of getting congressional representation for Washington D.C? Never mind
the career lawyers he first consulted who said, "no way, it's unconstitutional".
Holder went past them and into [political
territory](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123863025435480649.html) to make the
case that the always-Democratic District of Columbia might some day pick up
seats in Congress. Nice, Mr. Holder. When legal opinion fails you, go for
partisan politics.

Ahh, Eric, I was so on your side when you dumped the bullshit Stevens
indictment. Now, you're just angling for a partisan win. Every lawyer outside
the beltway worth his salt knows that D.C. is not a state. Why don't
you?
