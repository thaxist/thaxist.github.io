I watched [The Strangers](http://www.thestrangers.net/) last night, an
unfortunate movie, if only because its sole aim is to scare the dickens out of
you, but (at least in my case) fails miserably. (Actually, I should say that I 
_re-watched_ The Strangers, this time at the offices, in the dark, and
completely alone, hoping for that jolt of fear. Nothin'.) Let me explain.

First, if you haven't seen it, it's essentially the Manson Family idea: two
women and a man in creepy masks descend on a house in the country to harrass a
hapless couple, who're staying at the house for the night (the house of the
young man's parents, who aren't there). That's the basic idea.

As for the couple, Liv Tyler plays Kristen McCay, who has recently rejected a
marriage proposal from the now-frustrated James Hoyt, played by Scott Speedman. 
I thought the chemistry between the main characters was fine; the problem creeps
in (no pun) when the bad guys show up. This is made known by the obligatory
eery knock on the door, at four in the morning (which terminates the unfolding
love scene&mdash; thanks a lot!), resulting in a peculiar exchange with a young
woman at the doorstep, dead of night in the country, asking for someone in a
dead pan I'm-in-a-horror-movie voice. 

But Hoyt blows this off, and shortly after goes to get cigarettes for McCay,
leaving her in the house by herself (yeah, right). Of course, you guessed it,
the creeps from outside are soon inside, and the cat and mouse game begins. 

By the time Hoyt arrives with the smokes, McCay is freaked. He's still got the
dismissive must-be-okay attitude, but after seeing one of the antagonists
standing menacingly in the shadows outside one of the windows, he digs out the
family shotgun. Now, with two women and a man wearing Halloween masks in the
country, in the early hours of the morning, with no phone access (the hard
line's dead, and the one cell phone got chucked into the fireplace by the bad
guys, who seem to be making excursions into the house to perform particular
missions, only to go back outside to stand around and look scary), it would seem
that there are two reasonable moves for our antagonized lovers.

One, _get in the car and drive off_ . Two, retreat to a room of your choice
(with no windows behind you, etc.), and sit there with the 12 guage and the
several dozen shells Hoyt pocketed, and _wait for daylight_ . Bad guys with
Halloween masks disappear when the sun comes up (same goes with the audience's
fear). Then, simple equation: bad guy shows up with knife, shoot bad guy. 
That's easy enough.

Neither option happens until it's too late, though Hoyt and McCay do,
eventually, attempt to drive off (what a concept!), but get rammed by the creeps
in their creepy pickup and end up back at the house.

So, move one failed, proceed to move two. Sit there with the shotgun and wait
it out. This was too boring, apparently; better to run around, finding creepy
places, exposing yourself to danger. Be the victim! Feel the victim! Oh well.

Incidentally, one thing I did find interesting: a menacing knock on one's door
(with no peephole... that's cheating) in the middle of the night, in the middle
of nowhere, does present a dilemma. Open it up, might be bad. Yell through the
door? I guess, but then if it seems harmless, you're obliged to open it ("What
the hell do you want?" "Uh, my car broke down, I'm cold, and lost..."). Doing
nothing seems a little too cautious (maybe even a little _pusillanimous_ ), and
shooting through the door without understanding the situation is obviously
absurd. Assuming there's no phone access, what would _you_ do? Unfortunately,
entertaining this mildly insipid question is the closest The Strangers came to
pulling me into the Creep
Zone.
