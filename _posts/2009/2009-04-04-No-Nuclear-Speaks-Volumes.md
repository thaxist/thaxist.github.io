If the threat of Global Warming is so dire, and so immediate, why not adopt
nuclear power, like France? Compared to wind or solar, it's much more economic
(I've heard wind is X10 the cost of coal, and nuclear X1.5), and pretty much
everyone not stuck in 1970s Sierra Club environmentalism agrees that it's safe
today. So, in the face of such grave environmental challenges, why not do like
France, and adopt cheap, clean, nuclear? Or, are we not serious yet? Still
pie-in-the-sky-I-wish-the-world-was-different-everyone-turn-your-lights-off-for-an-hour,
unserious _posers_ .

Nuclear means we're serious about reducing emissions. It's not carbon, and it
actually works. Nuclear is the solution if the problem is so damn imminent. If
no nuclear, no seriousness from the Left about claims of impending
doom.
