Neil Williams' eyes squinted in the light diffuse through the window of his
studio apartment and at once he felt that sinking feeling of sobriety after so
long as King. Reasons. Problems. Worries. And a headache.

He could never eat, after a night like last. 

Without eating came withdrawal, and with withdrawal, more beer. This hopeless
cycle Neil had come to accept, but the price he paid for being King was obvious
enough. He was no fool.

She was fast asleep and he instantly hated her. Playing her part in his
failures and still here. The ones that stayed, they were the worst. Fucking
bitch. There was beer in the fridge and that was the only thought that brought
with it less than full depression.

After a six pack of beer he could face her, well enough to get her out of his
place without incident, anyway. She'd want to go get coffee or something like
that, but she was a fool, and it would be hours before he could see her again as
King.

He could never eat, after a night like last, and so he'd drink the beer, poured
in a cup, sitting on his patio and wait until part of the King would show. Then,
he could eat. And maybe she'd have left, or at least he could talk to her. 

Somehow the apartment complex had deposited the trash dumpster directly across
the way from his patio. Late at night, raccoons would sniff into it, and he
would watch them on his patio. Surly bastards. Walk across the street with
your shirt off and a slosh of whiskey and stare them down. 

Three messages on his phone. Don't look until that first beer. No, don't look
until several. The world was full of perky imbeciles organizing and arranging
their lives as if they might be King through nervous energy and schedules. But
you can't be King that way. King is King.

She rises and starts talking but by now he's into his third beer and her image
and the sounds she emits have become bearable.

"What's up?" she says. Geez. It will be a while before he's King
again.
