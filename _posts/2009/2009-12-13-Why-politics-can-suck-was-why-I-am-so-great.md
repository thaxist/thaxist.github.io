We have this Hotty who visits our office; she's the original Neocon. She's
married to a military guy, loves her country, listens to country music, and
probably has a stars and stripes bikini (wish I had an image to upload).

So Hotty comes into our office one day, the random pop-your-head in suddenly
we're talking politics day. I'm a Ron Paul-type libertarian with shades of
standard conservatism (think William F. Buckley, not George W. Bush, though I
kind of liked Bush, actually), which means that Hotty and me, our Venn diagram
of agreement is working out pretty well on this day.

Then, it happens. The first hint of why politics sucks (was: first hint of my
greatness). I mention Palin's a know-nothing (a bit overstated, but most people
can see my point), and suddenly she's nodding in that
I'm-not-really-agreeing-but-don't-know-what-to-say manner. It occurs to me
later that this is just one more case of how politics is like rooting for sports
teams. It's so devoid of thought. _But we LIKE Palin! What's your problem? 
She you-betcha's those Ivory Tower snobs!_ Right, sorry. I should have said:
she ain't no know-nuthin' (and if she is, "know-nuthin'" is good!).

Consider:

Hotty's core argument about Obama was that "he gives really good speeches, he
electrifies crowds, he's good at campaining, but he isn't really President
material"; he's not really suited for the rigors of the Presidency. "Where's
the beef?" is the objection from Hotty, in other words.

But, isn't this exactly the obvious charge against Palin for President? She's
great at giving speeches and campaigning, but she can't tell Katie Couric what
she reads, or why the proximity of Alaska to Russia confers foreign policy
experience on her. Somehow the God-fearin', military supportin', country music
listenin' crowd thinks Palin got screwed out of the White House (by the media, I
guess, or by them _liberals_ ), while they simultaneously think that the guy
who currently inhabits the White House is just some good speech giving, fast
talking campaigner, who lacks the _gravitas_ that it takes to be President. 
Huh?

This is why, when thinking about politics, fair minded people realize that it
can suck. When we squeeze it, you see, more logic should come out. But we just
get a kind of red or blue ooze. _Mmmmmm. Ooooooze._
