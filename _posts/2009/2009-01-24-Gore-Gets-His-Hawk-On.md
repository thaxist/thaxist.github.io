Richard Clarke (former Clinton antiterror czar), in his "Against All Enemies"
book, describes a surprisingly hawkish Al Gore, arriving late to a meeting with
White House Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler and President Clinton on the subject of
"extraordinary rendition" &mdash; the practice of sending prisoners to foreign
countries to be interrogated. Mr. Cutler was strongly objecting to the rendition
option, and, as Clarke recounts, had seemed to sway Clinton in his direction,
when Gore arrived. According to Clarke, Clinton briefed Gore on the arguments
presented in the meeting, and "Gore laughed and said, 'That's a no-brainer. Of
course it's a violation of international law, that's why it's a covert action.
The guy is a terrorist. Go grab his ass.'"

Gore's _machiavellian moment_ raises interesting and obvious moral questions
that I won't broach here. But his remark also underscores my own suspicion that,
likely, "enhanced interrogation techniques" will continue to be practiced by the
CIA whenever it's believed that such practices may reduce clear and present
threats to national interest (such as, say, obtaining information from an
Al-Queda operative about a planned attack). For all the hay making about the
Bush administration's policies &mdash; and I'll have more to say in another post
about why it'll be _virtually impossible_ to get a single prosecution if
AG-designate Eric Holder ever proceeds with "torture investigations" &mdash;
covert techniques will likely continue, as I suspect they have for decades, and
under Democratic or Republican administrations. As Mr. Gore puts it, of course
it'll violate laws... that's why it's _covert_ .

So I think the upshot here is that the Bush administration is guilty indeed, but
of a political blunder, and a bad one: next time, _don't brag about use of
enhanced techniques_ as if it's scoring political points at home. It isn't.
Just leave it covert, and we'll all be on our
way.
