This was 
[hilarious](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/28/dick-armey-to-joan-walsh_n_162020.html)
. Armey lets slip the dogs of politically incorrect war. He hits Joan Walsh with
no less than "glad you can never be my wife", a comment that was over the top,
to be sure.

But on the general contours of the stimulus discussion, it's becoming a
commonplace for the Democrats to talk around the stimulus bill rather than about
it, a sure sign that something's rotten in Denmark. There's suddenly very little
direct explanation of how the stimulus _happens_ . This was, I suspect, Dick
Armey's frustration, a man with a Ph.D. in Economics (not that this gives anyone
much of a leg up these days...) and of course the former House Majority leader.

Republicans, whatever you think of them as a party, have a point when they harp
on the details of the stimulus package that just passed the House. They're doing
the people's work right now more than the party in charge. Mad Money's Jim
Kramer &mdash; hardly an apologist for Conservatives &mdash; said as much today.
But Armey I think forgot himself on Hardball
tonight...
