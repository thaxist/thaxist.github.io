This is great. Kristina Vandanhoover gets reamed by Lawrence O'Donnel, a
liberal and self-proclaimed fellow Socialist, who nonetheless sought fit to
point out the political idiocy of the Left on the Health Debate. [Watch
it](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036789/#34477942) on Morning Joe (it starts at
about 13:30 on the clip, but the entire discussion is well worth watching).

(Notice how Vanden Heuval has NO sense of humor? She doesn't get what's
happening, and just sort of proselytizes, and filibusters, and it's so fun to
watch!)

Enjoy!
