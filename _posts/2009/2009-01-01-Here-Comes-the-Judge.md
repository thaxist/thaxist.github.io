I've argued previously (though not on this blog) that the Second Amendment makes
no sense if it's not construed as granting an _individual_ right to bear arms.
 Opponents of this view typically invoke a strand of Constitutional originalism:
 the Second Amendment says you have a right to _form militias_ , not have a gun
for self-defense. (Politics makes strange bed-fellows; progressives who
suddenly discover the value of Constitutional originalism.)

My argument for the individual right to bear arms is grounded in the absurdity
of granting folks the right to band together to form militias but denying the
right in the case of a solitary individual. If gun toting militias are
protected by the Second Amendment, _a fortiori_ should individuals.

But my argument has a flaw, which I've recently come to realize; namely, that
the "militia" language in the Second Amendment is interpreted as a statement
about federalism: _the states_ , under the "militia" reading, have the right
to form militias. This makes more sense. And, alas, it leaves unanswered the
separate question about whether the right to bear arms extends to individuals
for the purposes of self defense (the right in both cases &mdash; individual or
state &mdash; is essentially intended as protection against tyranny).

Anyway, the Heller decision last year upheld the _individual rights_
interpretation of the Second Amendment. As might be expected it was cheered by
opponents of Gun Control. Interesting, however, that conservatives like George
Will have [questioned the Heller
decision](http://www.thestarpress.com/article/20081124/OPINION/811240304) . 
Will points to 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Wilkinson's argument that
Heller, like, over three decades ago, Roe v. Wade, uses the ambiguous wording of
the Constitution as license for judicial subjectivity. With Heller, we get an
individual gun right from the ambiguous language of the Second Amendment. With
Roe v. Wade, we get a right to privacy that exists somehow in the due process
clause of the 14th Amendment ("under the penumbra" is I think the famous
phrase). 

Wilkinson argues that judicial subjectivity is not the bromide for
Constitutional ambiguity; rather, the matter should shift to legislation:

"...when a right's definition is debatable, generous judicial deference should
be accorded to legislative judgments &mdash; particularly those of the states,
which should enjoy constitutional space to function as laboratories for testing
policy variations."

I hate to admit it, but I tend to
agree.
