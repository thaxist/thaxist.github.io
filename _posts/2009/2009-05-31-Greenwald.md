[Glenn
Greenwald](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/05/31/rosen/index.html?source=rss&amp;aim=/opinion/greenwald)
. So cynical I get these days. He fires out blog after blog deterministically
anti-Bush administration but couched so much in the language of general
"accountability" and "fairness" and so many other moralisms that give the
appearance of journalistic objectivity. Drop the show. I'll eat my hat (many
hats I have, I'll pick the one that has a chance of going down with minimal
dyspepsia) if Greenwald in his crystal ethical palace ever turns the
gripe-thrower (like a flame thrower, but it throws partisan gripes) at a
non-Conservative office holder. In Limbaugh-like fashion this legal officianado
has made his career writing books and blogging about the links between Bush
adminstration and Hitler. But of course, we're to believe that this is all about
"accountability" and "respect for law" and so on. He's the whistle blower. Only,
the whistle blows so selectively, and when the last enemy recedes into history
he'll need immediately to grab onto another. Deterministically, a Republican.

On another, related note, I'm convinced that people who read too much
news&mdash;especially online&mdash;become dumber, and less educated. Much like
we thought T.V. would do. Go read a
book.
