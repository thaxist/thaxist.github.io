Hollywood has long attacked good literature by burning it with kerosine,
salamander patches on the director's arm. A little of the 
_[451](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451)_ . But they don't. Of
course. They do it rather by making movies. I unfortunately stumbled into
"Bright Lights, Big City", the 1988 film based on Jay McInerney's 1984 novel of
the same name. Oh god, where do I even start? How about with that perpetual
pip-squeak of an actor, Michael J. Fox (separate his acting from his more recent
medical problems), who rocketed to stardom in the 1980s playing gee-whiz
characters in such cinematic _tours de force_ as The Secret of My Success and
Doc Hollywood. In Bright Lights (an old movie of course, but it flew into my
living room tonight on the wings of DirectTV channels and stupid boredom) he's
playing the Hollywood version of McInerey's protagonist, a coke-snorting,
ambitious but lost 20 something wading through the yuppy drug scene of 1980s New
York, running from shattered romance and into, well, bright lights, and the Big
City. The novel was _edgy_ . The film? The film castrated it with poor casting,
a John Hughes-like feel, and a movie product better suited for inclusion in
episodes of [The Wiggles](http://www.thewiggles.com.au/us/home/) than serious
cinema. Whatever. As Motley Crue once noted, _it's the same old, same old song
and daance_ . Grab the novel, instead. Bag the
movie.
