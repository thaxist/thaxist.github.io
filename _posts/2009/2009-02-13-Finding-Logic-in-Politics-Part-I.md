(1) Running up the deficit is bad (tenet of responsible government, as both
Democrats and Republicans insist)

(2) Republicans ran up the deficit (fact)

(3) Democrats say: Republicans shouldn't lecture Democrats about running up the
deficit (refer to (2))

(4) Democrats are now running up the deficit (fact)

(5) Republicans say: Democrats shouldn't be running up the deficit (refer to
(1))

So it goes that both sides score political points that sound good on cable news,
but given the bi-partisan acknowledgement that running a large (nay, massive)
tab for future tax payers is bad, the parties are as usual tangled in their own
webs. If the stimulus bill doesn't work (and by the way, with something as
complicated as the modern global economy, _no one knows what will work_ ), the
Democrats just voted themselves out of office two years in advance. 
Republicans, perhaps not from an appreciation of the unpredictability of complex
systems _per se_ , have sounded off in usual form about "pork", but in factual
support of their opposition our deficit grows larger now on the Democrats'
watch, and add to this, no one currently breathing air today has any clue if the
latest bill will end the recession sooner, or prolong it by creating
inflationary problems, or do nothing. No one knows. How could they? You'd
have to be Laplace's Demon. And so it's a bold, swift move
indeed.
