The other day I heard an expert on MSNBC talking about Afghanistan (or was it
Iraq?), and at some point he offered that such and such _begs the question_ of
whether we should do such and such (as you can tell, I can't remember the
details of the discussion).

As a philosopher, this use of begs the question is annoying. Begging the
question as even an undergraduate student in argument or logic will know, means
assuming what you are attempting to prove. The classic example is the ditty
about knowing the Bible is the word of God because it says so. In the modern
context, we can beg the question about troop levels in Afghanistan by first
assuming that they should be higher and then concluding so. Or what have you.

What our expert meant to say was that such and such _raises the question_ . 
Suggesting or raising questions is what circumstances and observations do. 
Begging questions is much less common, and must by necessity involve some
circular reasoning. So, to the pundits and smart people out there and just to
everyone, stop begging the question when you're just raising
one.
