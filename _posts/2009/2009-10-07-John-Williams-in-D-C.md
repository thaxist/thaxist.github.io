John Williams burst on the scene like a superhero, shoulder pressing several
members of Code Pink in one hand, slamming a double Jack and Coke in the other.
At this moment, he could do no wrong. He was Tiger Woods playing golf, Kobe
Bryant shooting hoop, Peyton Manning throwing the football. But it couldn't
last. As Williams strided toward the West Face of the Capitol building, a member
of Code Pink reached down and managed to untie his shoe, generating a cascade of
events that resulted in his ignominous fall, scattering the remainder of his
beverage onto the shocked crowd and depositing Code Pink in front of the Capitol
no worse for the wear. Williams never got the deals at the Capitol. He'd be
damned if he would stand for this again. But already through the crowd
congealing around him the Pinksters were gone, and the Capitol police were
beginning to look his way. He turned his back to the crowd and strutted away. 
Later that afternoon, he was found staring at a moon rock in the aeronautics
museum. Sulking. Pensive. He never got the deals in
D.C.
