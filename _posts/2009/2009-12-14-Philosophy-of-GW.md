From a recent email I wrote:

I don't think there's a "Godelian" argument that the models are necessarily
poor, but as a horse sense rule, when people tell me they can predict the
future, I start wondering. That's an old trick.

The difference between local weather systems&mdash; which are chaotic in the
sense that they have a sensitive dependence on initial conditions &mdash; and
global temp is that, in the former, we have causes, while in the latter, the
causal mechanisms are still unclear.

I mean, in a chaotic system we all know that laws like Boyles etc. etc. apply,
it's just that the actual complexity of the system means that there isn't any
way to set up some differential equations and get the future state from some
specification of the initial state. It's hopeless, actually, as scientists like
Lorenz showed as early as the 1960s. (This is why, when we get models of likely
trajectories for hurricanes making landfall, they essentially draw out a set of
paths that are so broad that Grandma could do the same with a crayon).

With mean global temp, we have to have a causal mechanism that we know reliably
pushes the temperatures up, given the presence of the cause. This is the
"sufficiency" condition that philosophers speak of: many factors may be
necessary, but we need to know what subset of them are sufficient to make the
entire temperature of the Earth rise. This is not a chaotic system, but more
like the modeling of social science systems, or the economy: too hard to tell
what subset gives us the sufficiency condition. So, when we see the mean global
temp trend down between 1940 - 1960, even while massive amounts of C02 were
getting released into the atmosphere, it's puzzling. Fair minded people ask: 
if C02 is the sufficient condition, why then doesn't it graph directly? In
other historical periods, also, when C02 was much higher than now, why was
temperature comparably low, and what have you? This is the sort of stuff that
Lindzen at MIT asks, and so on.

For my part, the climatologists can work out the details of ice core records and
so on, but I think it's fairly obvious that there's more going on than C02 (it
could of course be a necessary condition, or it could be sufficient given
background factors N, in which case we should be asking a lot more questions
about N, like if N = {water vapor,...}, and so on.)

So this is kind of Popperian philosophy of science, where you have to figure out
what you're really claiming, and what falsifies it, etc.

Anyway, as I said, others can work out the details (assuming they're honest
about what they're measuring), but I'd like to see the sufficiency case made
more obvious, so that we can stop having the debate. (Put it another way, if
the sufficiency case is that damn obvious, someone should let us in on it,
instead of airing guilt-trip [videos of children
