Orbitz recently [changed their
commercial](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091211173333AA8EfJx) .
 Yahoo! answers' best reply says it was because of thin-skinned letter writers. 
Complaining about what!??? That an extra "ez" after "Hernandez" is racist, or
insensitive to Hispanics? What a crock of shit! This is text book PC: short
on any substantive insult, long on folks with a chip on their shoulder and a
one-dimensional perspective that is as intellectually sharp as a [splitting
maul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_maul) , and used with roughly the
same purpose. Imagine that ignoramus, imagine the kind of mind it would take,
to get fired up about the extra "ez" in the original commercial, and to take
arms against this imaginary sea of troubles. Wow! Wow! 
WOW!
