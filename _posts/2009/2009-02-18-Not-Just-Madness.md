A scene in the eminently watchable [Michael
Clayton](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/) shows a bedroom wall adorned
with a message from lawyer-gone-mental-patient Arthur Edens (played by Tom
Wilkinson): "Make Believe It's Not Just Madness".

What is it supposed to mean? I won't get into the movie, but will offer the
following interpretations:

(1) It's not only madness, it's also something else, unspecified. It could be
madness and indigestion. Or madness and foot rot. Pretend it's so.

(2) It's not only madness, it's a mix of madness with other explanatory factors,
like jealosy, or shame, or guilt. Pretend it's this larger web of humanizing
factors. Not just madness.

(3) It's madness, but it's not _just_ . He had no right to go mad. So, make
believe it's madness point blank, without just cause. 

Is it ((not just) madness) or (not (just
madness))?
