I rarely read Will like 
[this](http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/03/01/0301will_edit.html)
. I take it he's feeling journalistically mistreated. I agree with him &mdash; I
hope not out of cynicism but epistemic humility &mdash; that in a couple of
decades, we'll be on to some new claim about the Earth writ large and what all
industrialized nations must do immediately to avert disaster. It's worth a read
if you follow George Will, though I haven't followed up on his references (i.e.,
to the NYT
article).
