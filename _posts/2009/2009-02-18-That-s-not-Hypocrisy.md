David Shuster on MSNBC's [1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23580538/) regularly has a segment on
hypocrisy, typically devoted to highlighting anything unflattering about
Republicans. (Hey, who ever said cable news was real journalism?). Today he
points out that Republicans like Eric Cantor originally attacked the stimulus
bill for not adequately addressing the housing downturn; now after the latest
(how many more billion?) housing legislation, he's declared that we can't afford
it, and opposes it. "That's hypocrisy!" Shuster exclaims, the satisfying
tagline to the ever-entertaining Hypocrisy Watch on 1600.

If anyone cares, it's not hypocrisy, by any definition I'm familiar with. It's
perhaps opportunism, and certainly it's _prima facie_ inconsistent, but if it's
hypocrisy, Cantor needs not just to change his mind, but to profess something
publically while doing something at odds with his words privately. Espousing,
at different times, two public views that taken together seem inconsistent is
not hypocrisy. But then, real hypocrisy is revealed typically only in scandals,
and for programs that air five days a week, who's got the time to wait for
those?
