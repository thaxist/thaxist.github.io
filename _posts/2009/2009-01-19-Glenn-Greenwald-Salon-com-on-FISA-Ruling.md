More on warrantless wiretapping in the courts. The Wall Street Journal editorial
(find it 
[here](http://thethaxis.blogspot.com/2009/01/surprising-fisa-ruling.html) with
my initial commentary) made mention of the limited _scope_ of the recent FISA
ruling &mdash; it applies only to the 2007 Congressional authorization of
eavesdropping powers &mdash; but perhaps a little too quickly. Greenwald makes
it [a bit more clear](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/#postid-updateB2)
. However, as Greenwald himself admits, the ruling is still "significant". WSJ
said as much or more when concluding that it "sets a precedent".

In general, I'm interested to see how Obama treats the terrorist fighting
apparatus erected by the Bush administration after September 11: the warrantless
wiretapping issue, Guantanamo, homeland security, and a host of other issues
that, on the one side, are intended to keep us safer, and on the other, present
challenges to our liberty. This double edged sword will be held in his hand soon
enough.
