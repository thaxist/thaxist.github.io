BTW, while we're throwing quotes around, here's one from an article Reich wrote
yesterday: <BR/> <BR/> "When even these coping mechanisms were exhausted,
families went into debt &mdash; a strategy that was viable as long as home
values continued to rise. But when the housing bubble burst, families were no
longer able to easily refinance and take out home-equity loans. The result:
Americans no longer have the money to keep consuming. When you consider that
consumers make up 70 percent of the economy, the magnitude of the problem
becomes apparent. <BR/> <BR/> What happened to the money? According to
researchers Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, since the late 1970s, a greater
and greater share of national income has gone to people at the top of the
earnings ladder. As late as 1976, the richest 1 percent of the country took home
about 9 percent of the total national income. By 2006, they were pocketing more
than 20 percent. But the rich don't spend as much of their income as the middle
class and the poor do &mdash; after all, being rich means that you already have
most of what you need. That's why the concentration of income at the top can
lead to a big shortfall in overall demand and send the economy into a tailspin.
(It's not coincidental that 1928 was the last time that the top 1 percent took
home more than 20 percent of the nation's income.)" <BR/> <BR/>
