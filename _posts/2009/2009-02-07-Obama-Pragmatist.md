Gail Collins offers in the NYT today [an apology for
Obamaites](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/opinion/07collins.html) ,
attempting I assume to both placate and wisen them up. I'm hardly worried about
Obama's presidency this early on, but it is interesting how public support has
slipped both for him (from 80s to 60s, though this is typical), and for the
stimulus bill which, if not passed, he's declared could lead to economic
catastrophy. Wow. What happened?

Here's the problem. Obama won office with promises of change in Washington. 
Within weeks, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi crafted a spending bill that even the
down-and-out Republicans found big holes to poke and big political points to
gain. It's not that the Republicans were that brilliant, mind you. The House
bill was just _that bad_ . In other words, weeks after Bush exits and change
enters, it's more politics as usual. The initial House stimulus bill was so
embarrassing that Obama contacted Pelosi, requesting removal of funding for
contraceptives and resodding of the White House Mall. Good for him.

Even so, large swaths of proposed spending are still earmarked for goverment and
health care sectors, which are suffering about a third of the unemployment that
is wreaking steady havoc on manufacturing and construction. It's hard not to
recognize the tension with, on the one hand, rhetoric about immediate action to
stave off _economic catastrophy_ , and on the other, spending nearly a
trillion tax payer dollars in a manner that, so far, has been difficult to
defend as straightforward stimulus. If we are headed for catastrophe, why is it
still politics as usual? 

We're used to hearing by now that _political pragmatism_ is the antidote to
partisan bickering and gridlock. It's what the smart politicians do, we're
told. Indeed the pragmatist label has adorned Obama's politics since if not his
presidential campaign at least his tone while President-Elect, and mostly it
still sticks. But the latest poll numbers suggest that "pragmatism" cashed out
only as compromise on spending packages that are increasingly viewed with
sceptism is politically hazardous. It's also, substantively speaking,
inaccurate. Obama will be a pragmatist not because he accepts compromises that
assuage political parties but because he adheres to the notion that partisan
interests should be subjugated to practical ones in times of crisis. Pushing
through flawed legislation by courting votes isn't enough. The truly pragmatic
standard is in fact much higher. 

Obama must explain how the current 800 billion dollar package will _in fact
create jobs and help the economy_ . We need plain language about how the
deficit increase will get offset by job creation. (Liberal media mouthpieces
like Rachell Maddow have proclaimed recently how it's so obvious that _spending
just is stimulus_ . She means that _stimulus just is spending_ . On the
latter, not the former, we all agree. Tax cuts are of course spending too. No
worries, Rachell.) So, we need our new President to work us through the logic of
the bill, or explain what the Hill needs to do to fix it, or scrap it. That's
pragmatism. The stimulus package is a tool that we must understand will solve
the current problem. 

"Ideas are tools" was a slogan of the 19th century American pragmatists.
Whatever works, is what ought then to be regarded as True. Generations of
thinkers have poked holes in this idea on theoretical grounds, but for our
current conundrum, ideas-as-tools is much better than ideas-as-abstractions. 
This is particularly true with the economy (and especially the complex, global
economy), because it's increasingly hard to peer into the future to see how
ideology will work in complicated contexts. This is why the Keynesian versus
supply side debate seems so stale these days; who knows any more what will work?
 Pragmatists will start with what we know &mdash; say, the data in the
Congressional Budget Office reports &mdash; and work bottom up towards some
practical solution, however it looks through the lens of ideology.

But regardless of how we view the larger philosophical issues here, it's clear
that political pragmatism understood as simply _passing more spending
legislation_ , skewed this way and that to make politicians happy, is hardly
confidence inspiring. This is just politics as usual. For 800 billion tax
payer dollars, we deserve
more.
