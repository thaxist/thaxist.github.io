I've been following aviation for a while now; my dad is a retired pilot for US
Airways, where he flew the 737 (he may have flown _you_ at one time, if you
flew in the 1990s). I myself completed ground school last year and have a few
hours flight training time in a Cessna 150.

What the heck... this latest the most amazing story... a swept wing dual engine
commercial jet at just over 3,000 feet loses power in both engines. This is
almost certainly a recipe for disaster, and yet here's the news reporting no
casualities and a successful "ditch" (a technical term meaning it isn't a crash
but a controlled water landing) into the Hudson. This is really something. At
roughly 200 knots a plane of that size with even partial engine failure will
require an immediate nose down (i.e., it can't keep climbing!). And with the
catastrophic engine failure on flight 1549 there's no routing to an alternate
airport, and the pilot, Chesley Burnett "Sully" Sullenberger III, has no time to
do much of anything. He initiates a bank (while losing altitude quickly, I would
imagine), and kisses it down on the Hudson with no fuselage failure, and with
155 people (2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 150 passengers) alive. "Nice job"
doesn't really capture the moment. This is just simply amazing.

Incidentally, I asked my father once if he ever had a scare when flying
commercial for US Air (this conversation happened in November 2001, after a 757
crashed shortly after takeoff from JFK, no survivors). He responded, in his
usual matter-of-fact fashion, that he had only one scare. In a blizzard, taking
off from Philadelphia. The planes had been grounded for a while, and finally
they got a green light to go, which I think was "green" for reasons not entirely
explainable by safety criteria alone (management, losing money, saying get the
planes up in the sky).

Taking off in a blizzard. Next time you do it, remember this: the turbines in a
jet can "flame out" when ingesting liquid, which means effectively that they,
well, flame out, like a candle no longer lit. A severe enough storm such as a
blizzard can literally extinguish the jet engines (it's rare, but it can
happen). This is effectively what happened to my father, except the engines
didn't extinguish, they "burped", as he put it.

Taking off, there's a speed that, once reached, requires that the pilot attempt
to get the aircraft airborn, called "V1". The crew on the Philly takeoff had
reached V1, and so had nothing left to do but cross their fingers, sitting on
burping jets in a blizzard with hundreds of people on board, hoping that the
engines wouldn't flame out.

I asked what dad and the other pilot said to each other later, and he just said
they looked at each other and took a breath, and that was that. Well, dad's a
pilot.

Congrats to the pilot on 1549! All lived (except the
geese).
