Conservatives may be squawking lately about Pres. Obama imposing [executive
salary caps](http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/04/america/prexy.4-423182.php) 
at 500K a year when their firms have accepted bailout tax payer money, but it's
a great incentive for the private sector to avoid the turn left towards
socialism. It's not Adam Smith, but it's surely a pointer towards the market
economy, not away from it.

Why? It's logical, that's why. If your firm has a business model that does not
require bailouts, then by all means, pay your executives what the market will
allow. Fat cats are the by-product of wide open, entrepreneurial,
anyone-can-be-anything societies. Bill Gates. It makes sense. On the other hand,
if you need government to operate, you should expect now to be _governed_ . We
can hardly accept businesses wanting subsidies for failure and free market
principles for salaries. That's not capitalism.

And so, I applaud the salary caps. It's a nod towards
capitalism.
