In The New Testament, John 8:7, Jesus defends a sinful woman against an angry
crowd:

"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at
her."

In Schindler's List, the movie, Oskar Schindler challenges Amon Goeth's killing
of Jewish prisoners:

**Oskar Schindler:** Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we
don't.

**Amon Goeth:** You think that's power?

**Oskar Schindler:** That's what the Emperor said. A man steals something, he's
brought in before the Emperor, he throws himself down on the ground. He begs for
his life, he knows he's going to die. And the Emperor... pardons him. This
worthless man, he lets him go.

**Amon Goeth:** I think you are drunk.

**Oskar Schindler:** That's power, Amon. That is power.

What is this? Forgiveness, or power? In Matthew 21:12 Jesus walks into the
temple, yells, overturns tables, and drives out the banking crowd, later healing
the less fortunate in the vacant temple. What are we to make of this? Why didn't
he treat the money lenders as he did the sinful woman? Why did he judge the
bankers and not the prostitute?

These diametric opposites &mdash; forgiveness and judgement &mdash; are it seems
perpetually resistant to systematizing with ethical theories. They continue to
sit, unanalyzed, unresolved, through millenia of human history.

The history of human ethics is a commentary on the proper application of mercy
and judgement. So far we've come, and so long we continue to stand motionless
and without
understanding.
