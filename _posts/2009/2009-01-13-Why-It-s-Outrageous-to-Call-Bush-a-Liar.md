Yes, I know he bungled many aspects of the war in Iraq (including the decision
to wage it, in my view). Yes, I know about Mission Accomplished. Yes, I know
there were no WMD.

But here's why it's _outrageous_ to say that Bush lied to the American people
about _the existence of the WMD_ to get us into Iraq. To begin, if it was all
a lie, President Bush must have _known_ that there would be no mushroom cloud,
and no biological weapons, and that therefore there was no imminent threat,
because Saddam Hussein _had no active WMD_ . We have to believe he knew this
(it's in fact necessary to believe this to get the liar charge off the ground).
Two, given that President Bush knew this, he still committed his staff, the
international community, and thousands of American troops to wage a war that he
knew was not necessary at all.

Now, we need these two claims to support the "Bush lied" charge. This is the
logic (in a simplified version, but adequate to make the present point clear).
And here's where the liar charge starts to unravel. We are to believe that
President Bush, ignoring the best intelligence from the CIA, from Great Britain,
from France, and indeed China and Russia, had some _independent information_ ,
that in fact Iraq did not have WMD. That's, right, President Bush has this
secret intel&mdash; independent of the conclusions of the entire world
intelligence community &mdash; and that he therefore knew (or at least strongly
suspected) that there were no WMD in Iraq. That's what we have to believe. Put
aside worries about how possibly a guy commonly accused of being a bungling
ignoramus had such personal, penetrating intelligence about weapons in Iraq; to
make our "Bush is liar" charge we must simply suppose that he did.

Second, given that he has this independent source of intel that shows no WMD in
Iraq, he yet decides to launch a full scale attack, in the process pulling the
rest of the world into a pit of mortars and explosions and violence. In Hitler
like fashion, the diabolical Bush, _knowing there were no WMD_ , still lets
slip the dogs of war. And the rest of the world goes along with it (make
sinister sounds of laughter now).

Now, if you believe these two claims &mdash; that Bush _knew there were no WMD_
 in spite of the consensus of the intel community, and that he nonetheless 
_claimed that WMD were there_ (that's the lie part), then, well, you should go
around charging that Bush lied to us.

But if you find any problem with these claims (say, for instance, that Bush had
no such super-secret intel from some unknown, Godlike source), then probably you
don't mean that he lied about the existence of WMD in Iraq. Probably you mean
that you're against the war, and that it was a bad idea, and that even if Iraq
had some mustard gas, it would have been far preferable to let the UN
inspections proceed to an outcome that might have avoided war. (This is pretty
much what I believe.)

So, for those still inclined to use the word "lie" anyway, I'd say it's
outrageous (also fallacious, also disengenuous, also provocative, tendentious,
contentious, maddening, and, of course, itself
mendacious).
