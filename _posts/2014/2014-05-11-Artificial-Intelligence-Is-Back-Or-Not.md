Last year John Markoff of the NYT wrote about [the rapid advance of Artificial
Intelligence](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/technology/the-rapid-advance-of-artificial-intelligence.html?_r=0)
. This year, the New Yorker's Gary Marcus suggests that [it's all
hype](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/01/the-new-york-times-artificial-intelligence-hype-machine.html)
. Not only hype, but hype again. Marcus, a cognitive psychologist at New York
University, seems to have a point: how many times have we heard that the "smart
robots" are just around the corner?
