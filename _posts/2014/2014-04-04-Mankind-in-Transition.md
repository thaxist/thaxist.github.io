[A strange, almost creepy
book](http://www.amazon.com/Mankind-Transition-Distant-Present-Future/dp/1879981017/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396643451&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Mankind+in+Transition)
 by Masse Bloomfield, a guy I'd never heard of before. He offers a usable
description of technology, from tools, to machines, to automation. Argues that
our destination is interstellar travel (in contrast to someone like Kurzweil,
who would argue that our destination is the Machineland itself). His view of
robots, powered by Artificial Intelligence, appears to preserve the difference
between biologically-inspired minds and machines. He sees AI as necessary for
controlling robots, which will become ubiquitous in military applications. This
suggestion seems entirely plausible, actually (set aside the ethical dimensions
here), and his view of artificial intelligence as the software that controls
robots for practical uses seems, well, plausible too.
