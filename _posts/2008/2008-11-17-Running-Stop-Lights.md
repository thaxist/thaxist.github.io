I was driving down I think it was Lakeline a few weeks ago, and noticed a camera
pointing down at me at an intersection. I stopped a little past the line,
listening to music and I suppose not doing my best driving. At any rate, I had
some spell of worry after driving away, as if, somehow, the technology would
record not my running the light, but my stopping past the line. After a while I
recovered from my Orwellian paranoia; glad to say I haven't received a ticket
from this camera yet.

Later I talked with a friend about the privacy issue, and in particular the
issue of whether cameras should catch red light runners regardless of whether
any human (police officer) witnessed the event. My friend took a reasonable
position, saying in effect that, look, you've run the light or you haven't. Why
require that a cop be present at every light? Why not use technology, if it
works? After all, we don't have existential angst about police having
well-calibrated radar guns to catch speeders. Who argues with this?

It was a reasonable point, I suppose. But, after puzzling about it for a while,
I smelled a rat. My question was simple: suppose we had a technology that was
even better than cameras, or radar guns. It represented the completion of all
such technologies. It rode along with us, and, if you broke a law, it would
simply record the infraction, and send the ticket. So, if you run a stop light,
you get a ticket. If speeding, a ticket. If you happen to be risking more
serious infractions by driving after having too many, you'll be apprehended
later, sure as the sun rises, and will spend the night in jail. And on and on. 
The perfect completion&mdash;just the logical extension&mdash;of cameras at stop
lights. Any one for this?

My friend recoiled at the suggestion. I asked why, and after some mumbling and
fumbling, just declared that it wasn't right. Right. 

What's interesting is how, seemingly, more security makes such good sense, to a
point, and then suddenly it seems positively distopian. We're all for better
security when it doesn't feel like the State sucks away our autonomy. But, as
my thought experiment suggests, once we do feel this way, we recoil. 

It's worth thinking about the distinction between the two cases. Just decent
(not omniscient) technology like cameras at stoplights sounds great. But better
and better technology, and suddently we're holed up in Montana with guns. So
where does the issue really stand? I wonder. Flipping the coin, consider it
this way. Why should we be allowed to break the law, ever, and get away with
it, just for lack of technology? _We still broke the law._ Why, then, recoil
when law enforcement just _works better_
?
