There's an [interesting
article](http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/11/30/1130lacy.html)
in the Austin American Statesman today about a University of Texas at Austin
astronomy professor, John Lacy, quitting work on a NASA project that seeks to
"determine the chemical makeup of objects light years away." His problem? The
instrument Lacy developed, along with a telescope, are afixed to a modified
Boeing 747 that will be flying about four times a week between 8 - 12 hours each
time, according to the article. It's too much pollution for Lacy.

It's true, those who travel by jet are serious Co2 emitters; scientists
attribute "up to 3 percent of all carbon dioxide that contributes to global
warming to plane engines." Planes are specifically troubling to GW proponents
because their deposits of pollution in the upper atmosphere have a more severe
warming effect. (To the rich, who've taken up GW as their cause: stop _flying
around_ telling us that the planet has a fever! What's next, I visit
restaurants, chain-smoking, telling people about the horrors of second hand
smoke?)

Anyway, Lacy's out. Of course he's been supported (publically) by other
scientists, though curiously with luke warm language. Nicholas Veronico, head
of the project, gave his obligatory plaudits to Lacy in the article, then
pointed out that there's an average of 28,537 commercial flights handled by air
traffic control _each day_ . The effect, he says, will be minimal. That's an
understatement, Mr. Veronico.

Lacy's argument seems a little like a scientist who refuses to perform research
on developing better prosthetic limbs because it requires use of a certain
non-degrading plastic compound. Sounds pretty ethically first-rate, perhaps,
until one realizes that the compound is used in thousands of other projects and
products, and the percentage of the total amount used for improving prosthetics
is miniscule. Or, insert your favorite argument here.

As much as fellow scientists said kind things about Mr. Lacy, I think most
reasonable people should be skeptical of the value of his decision. I hope I
don't hear that he's flying home for Christmas any time
soon.
