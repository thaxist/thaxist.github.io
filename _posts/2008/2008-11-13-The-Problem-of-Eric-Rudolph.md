The supermax incarcerated abortion clinic bomber, in his words:

"I'm here today to be sentenced for my actions on January 29, 1998. On that
date I detonated a bomb at an abortion mill here in Birmingham, killing the
abortion mill's security guard and injuring one of the abortion mill's
employees. I had nothing personal against either of these individuals,
Sanderson and Lyons. I did not target them for who they were - but for what
they did. What they did was participate in the murder and dismemberment of
upwards of 50 children a week."

"My actions that day were motivated by my recognition that abortion is murder.
Because it is murder, I believe that deadly force is indeed justified in an
attempt to stop it. I do not claim this as a right but rather consider it the
moral duty to come to the defense of my fellow man when he is under attack. 
This is an essential concept embedded in Western Civilization - that we are our
brother's keeper."

Crazy, of course. But from a philosophical standpoint, troubling. The problem
is that his logic makes a certain sense, given the assumption that life begins
at conception. Of course his _violence is reprehensible_ , but it's a
troubling case, because his words are bluntly consistent, given a literal
interpretation of life at conception. I think it's his lunacy that ironically
helps us search for sanity in the abortion debate. We'll find the lunacy on the
Pro-Choice side as well.

So here goes, let's jump into abortion...

If life really begins at conception, isn't then abortion really murder? Think
it through. Pro Life proponents say it's just so: life begins at conception. 
But they don't really believe this, because even hard core Pro Life types tend
to make exceptions (e.g., for victims of rape). But if it's murder, it's
murder, whether the life began with an act such as rape or not. The rhetoric
isn't consistent with the policy. This is what I call the _strange logic_ to
Eric Rudolph, his (superficial) clarity. _They kill defenseless persons. I
kill them._ He took the message on face value. Bully for consistency. But
you're still crazy, Mr. Rudolph. We don't, in fact, treat a woman having an
early stage abortion on a par with someone committing infanticide, or just
killing someone else in the world. So something's gone wrong. Rudolph was
wrong.

Now Pro-Choice types have their own problem: if it's just all about a woman's
right to choose, if the life or possible life of the fetus is trumped by a right
to privacy (poof!, our Roe V. Wade result...), then why not partial birth
abortions? Why get weak-kneed in the third trimester? It's easy (and suspect)
to say just that the right to privacy _diminishes_ . Why? Because the cells
in your body gained more mass? But why should this matter? Sounds like losing
your nerve, mother-to-almost-be. Be strong. Privacy. Consistency. 
Eric-Rudolph-it.

Think of it this way, what's _really_ the difference between an organism (I use
this "person neutral" language just to get at the point) that exists, one
moment, in its mother, and the next minute, in the world? A few minutes? 
That's the difference? What wonderous changes could have happened through the
birth canal? C'mon. This too makes hardly any sense at all. 

So, Pro Choicers supportive of third term procedures must, somehow, ignore
weighty considerations of life, of human life, in their bodies. Strange that
otherwise normal people can manage this particular moral magic trick. A
judicially created right to privacy seems much too flimsy, obviously too
flimsly, to cancel the empirically obvious fact of a human life. And their
logic, like Mr. Rudolph's, leads them quickly into troubling waters. If they
see no problem with third trimester abortions (especially in cases where the
fetus could live outside the womb, if delivered), they ought not to balk at
infanticide, also. Because, again, what's the difference? If the _baby_ is
alive now, the _fetus_ was alive two minutes ago. (Running the argument the
other way, if the _fetus_ had no right to life a few minutes ago, how did the 
_baby_ suddenly acquire it?) 

Of course, the "infanticide" result is crazy too, just like Rudolph's "abortion
is murder" interpretation. So we've never figured out this debate. It's
horribly incomprehensible, when consistent, on both sides. Best left
inconsistent? Hardly
comforting.
