I hate to get into more discussions of Joe the Plumber, or more recently " [Ed
the Dairyman](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081020/ap_on_el_pr/palin) ", but...
here's my take on how small businesses will fair with McCain or Obama at the
helm...

McCain first:

Cutting the [corporate tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax) from
35 to 25%, as McCain proposes, clearly helps corporations. Fortunately (or
unfortunately), it's a progressive tax, and so the top marginal rate (35%)
applies only to corporations making at least 18.3 million a year (marginal
corporate tax rate on profits, usually considered gross revenue minus expenses).
 That's not Joe the Plumber. 

So, many truly small businesses, like those bringing in less than a million a
year, won't be subject to this rate (again, because the corporate tax in the
U.S. is progressive&mdash;the less the corporate entity makes, the less we tax
it). Try 15% for most small businesses. This does imply that reducing the top
corporate tax rate is really a boost to _the larger_ small businesses, and
also all of the large corporations in America. McCain's plan is a true tax cut
for "Corporate America" as liberals have charged. 35-to-25 benefits the big
dogs (but also, it should be noted, the businesses providing so many jobs). 

But here's the flip side. Obama keeps harping on the "95% get a tax cut" line,
but here's what it really means. First, taxable income, if you're a true _C
corporation_ (not e.g., an S corp), cannot be claimed as personal
taxes&mdash;you can't pay business taxes as a C corp by rolling them into
personal taxes. This inconvenient truth deflates the "less than 250K income"
balloon right off, since Obama is talking about personal [income
tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax) when making this claim. You small
c corp guys, your business will pay the [corporate
tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax) , and this rate is not on the
chopping block with the Obama plan (although take heart, a propos of my point
above, it's graduated for business revenues).

So far, so good. But the Obama plan has a Trojan Horse. Payroll tax, also
known as the FICA tax, is paid half by employee, half by employer. The Social
Security component is 6.2%, Medicare is 1.45%. Social Security is capped,
currently, at 97.5K of employee income, which means that, once an employee hits
$97,500.00 for the year, there is no further tax burden on employee or employer
to continue to pay the Social Security tax (Medicare taxes have no cap). 

Now, Obama's plan to raise the Social Security cap to 250K income, from 97.5K,
amounts to burdening small businesses with an additional tax, kicking in once
the 97.5K is reached. _This is not a tax cut for small businesses under 250K_
, as he claims, since these businesses are now burdened with the additional
Social Security tax for employee income over 97.5K, all the way to 250k, when it
used to be capped. And, a double hit, the employee is equally burdened; he or
she is paying the 6.2% Social Security tax on the income between 97.5K and 250K.
 6.2% of 250K is a lot of extra taxes (it's fully 12.4% including employer
share); we might think that folks making over 97.5K can just deal with it (I'm
sure they will), but effectively this is a tax on the leadership of small
businesses, especially high tech businesses, where salaries of CEOs, CTOs, and
other management and lead development positions are commonly more than 97.5K
(particularly in high cost of living urban areas, such as San Francisco or
Seattle, where white collar small businesses are often formed, and try to
thrive).

To stay on this point, payroll taxes are costly for small businesses; even if
you're not making a profit (and hence subject to the corporate tax... gotcha!),
you're paying payroll tax for _all_ of your employees. Think it doesn't
matter? Try paying it with little cash on hand. It matters. And, raising the
payroll tax to the 250K ceiling, laudable as this may be for addressing the
social security problem, certainly levies an additional tax on small businesses.
 In my experience, the payroll tax (with associated unemployment and state
taxes), are a _huge_ drag on very early stage small businesses, just breaking
new ground by hiring employees. 

So, no raised taxes below 250K of income? Tell that to the small businesses
paying more payroll taxes on their employees. If we're talking small business
growth and the encouragement of innovation, I'd rather see an elimination of
payroll on small businesses until they reach a certain number of employees, or a
certain amount of revenue. Encouraging American innovation&mdash;stimulating
very early stage small businesses to grow by exempting them from excessive tax
burdens&mdash;is a great way to reinvigorate our stagnating
economy.
