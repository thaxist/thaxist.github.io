William F. Buckley, as reported in Newsweek after his death:

"In his old age, he told his son, "I spent my entire life separating the right
wing from the kooks." Though it cost him contributors and readers, he banned
conspiratorial members of the John Birch Society from the pages of National
Review along with the anti-Semites who had stained the far right." 

How about now, today, someone steps forward to help strip off the
anti-intellectual clothes that have come to adorn, under the false guise of 
_philosophical conservatism_ , the Republican party? 

Folksy is as folksy does; the Repulbican party desperately needs conservative
leaders who understand and properly promulgate conservative ideals. What
happened? Suddenly big government, huge deficits, a kind of (and this hurts the
worse) country singer, "don't know much about" mentality that ceeds our national
debate to political liberals who have taken the time to become educated? And
nowhere, not even the whisper of suggestion that there are some worthy
principles undergirding a conservative (also, for the most part, libertarian)
worldview. _What happened_ ? Republicans, have, really, closed their minds,
and lost their
way.
