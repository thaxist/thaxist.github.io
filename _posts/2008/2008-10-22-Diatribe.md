"I think that when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." 
(Barack Obama, to enough-already "Joe the Plumber").

What, exactly, does this friggin' mean? I mean this in an entirely non-partisan
sense. What the hell does he mean? _Who_ is spreading it? The people who
have it? Geez, if I'm languishing in luxury, eating grapes and drinking fine
wine, and my neighbor is sitting in abject misery for lack of some crackers,
I'll sure as hell "spread the wealth"... but who is the "you" that Obama is
referring to? 

This seems partisan, but really, there's a deeper point. He's saying that "I
think that when government has the ability to take from some to give to others,
it's good for everybody." In some limited sense it's true. But in some
expansive sense it's sure as hell not. _Spreading the friggin' wealth_ ? It's
not margarine for God sakes. What the comment reveals is failure to understand
that it's not a zero sum game, as if "We all have some X, but some more than
others, and we can't count on getting any more, so we'd better gosh darn 
_share_ it...". What's next, rapping our knuckles with a ruler? This is
manifestly... ahh crap forget
it...
