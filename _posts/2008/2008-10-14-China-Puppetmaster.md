Long time friend and former colleague Mike Pool recently raised the ["China,
puppetmaster"](http://mijopo.livejournal.com/201132.html) spectre. I think
it's overblown. A fiction from the right and left, as follows: _China's
tentacles into the American economy are a pending catastrophe._ Perhaps. But
respected financial market strategist David Smick, in his recent book "The World
is Curved", recounts a discussion with a senior official at the New York Federal
Reserve, regarding what would happen to the US economy if China suddenly stopped
buying US Treasury securities. The official's response? Interest rates would
skyrocket. Maybe 35 basis points! Maybe even 50! (Smick was expecting 300-400
bp). That's hardly a meltdown. Investors in US bonds are a _huge_ and pretty
diversified pool. That said, I'm more worried about the "drip, drip, drip" of
gradual decline than a China
catastrophe...
