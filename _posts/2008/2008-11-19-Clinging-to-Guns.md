I plan to purchase a Smith & Wesson Model 629 .44 Magnum revolver with a 6 inch
barrel. It's the Dirty Harry gun. Why? Something of romantic overkill, sure,
but also self-defense, the much maligned concept that nonetheless persists with
so many as practical and, well, human. 

Classic scenario, if not over-used: when I'm travelling, my wife is in the home
alone with our two children (8, 7 years old). We have a firearm, currently, in
the home, which I taught her to use in the unthinkable situation where someone
attempted to assault them. Now, living in the country, I can estimate (without
claiming to precision), that it would take the local police force several
minutes, and likely, say, upwards of ten minutes to respond to a 911 call. In
that time, as I'm sure we can all imagine, so many horrors could be visited upon
my wife and kids, that I'd rather not continue.

It works like this: people who live in major cities, see major city problems
with guns. For those of us who live in the suburbs (read: in the country), the
thought of having responsible access to deadly force is not problematic but
comforting. I'm sure my neighbors have firearms as well. Bully for them.

It's difficult to see how the State could argue our comfort away; on what
grounds? I, for instance, am not a felon, have handled firearms since a kid,
taken gun safety courses, hunted my entire life, and on and on (same too,
mostly, with my spouse). And so, the argument to deny me a firearm is...?

As to inner-city gun violence, I'm well aware. My point isn't a blanket
argument about guns but rather a question of who should get them. I'm inclined
to make the law strict in this regard. Apply for your firearm. If you qualify,
wait a period, receive it. I'm not opposed to this.

Shifting gears, on a purely theoretical level, it's incomprehensible to me that
somehow our relationship with the State should be such that the State controls,
exclusively, the means of deadly force, and denies categorically the same to its
citizens. Again, if organized law enforcement _can't be everywhere_ , all the
time, why shouldn't well-meaning citizens provide for their own protection? We
are not, after all, children. The law provides (indeed, it's in the
Constitution, not by accident) for citizens to have access to firearms. _We're
not children._ 

Finally (to munge many points together here), "self defense" for me includes
also backpacking trips in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming, where the chances
of encountering a brown or black bear are non-trivial. Self-defense. I'm not
interested in testing theories about playing dead; I'd rather my kids see me
return home. Hence, a large-caliber
handgun.
