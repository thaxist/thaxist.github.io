The front page of the Austin American Statesman sports this, in bold block
letters:

**A 1,000,000,000,000 plan?** 

I'll admit that I had a hard time parsing the digits at first. Turns out it's a
cool trillion. A trillion dollar _plan_ ? Did I miss something? I know the
unemployment rate is, what, 6.7%, but the 
[breadline](http://history1900s.about.com/library/photos/blygd49.htm) is hardly
stretching around the city block. Maybe I suffer from a failure to predict the
something economically-wicked that this way comes. Fine. But, _a trillion
dollars?_ (I love how it's a nice even number too, like the calculating master
minds in the back gave up on more precision: "Hell, just make it a trillion. 
That oughta do it.") We're gonna break the freakin' [printing
press](http://www.orato.com/files/imagecache/storyimage/files/article/printing%20money.jpg)
...

The only bright spot reading this trillion dollar plan scenario came, for me,
when Speaker Pelosi went on record wanting something like 200 billion in tax
cuts. We've got bipartisan consensus now (FWIW) that reducing tax burdens help
stimulate the economy. Conservatives have been shouting this on a mountain for
a very long
time.
