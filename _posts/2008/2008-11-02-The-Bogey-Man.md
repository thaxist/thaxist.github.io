Liberals fulminate endlessly about the moral corruption in Big Business (Ralph
Nader is far and away the most energetic and clear spokesman here);
Conservatives seem endlessly wary of Big Government. There's something about
the human psyche, apparently, that requires a bogey man. Concentrates the
thoughts. We're best when we're in full fighting mode.

So then, reign in Big Business, says the Left, and reduce the size of
Government, says the Right (the _real_ Right). And curiously, those that
would shrink the power of one, would grow the power of the other. What gives?

Lord Acton's famous refrain that "power tends to corrupt and absolute power
corrupts absolutely" is the philosphical flame that illuminates the positions of
Left and Right. But I think there's an important difference. Government is a
more absolute power; people can quit jobs, and switch employers, or just opt out
of working completely. But Government occupies a more intimate and
comprehensive space. Acton's wisdom, while applying to all institutions that
have power, ought particularly to be heeded with regard to Government. This
thought I'll explain momentarily, but first let's discuss business.

The virtue (and vice) of business is to _maximize profit_ . It's the stated
objective, and well-known to all. It's out in the open and transparent. We all
know this, and pretending otherwise is rediculous (recall the scene in the movie
"Aviator" when Senator Owen Brewster assures everyone that President of
Pan-American Airways Juan Trippe "is not interested in making a profit... he's a
great American". To which Leonardo DiCaprios' Howard Hughes replies "I'm sure
his stock holders will be happy to here that".) 

Thus businesses rise or fall on their ability to fulfill the profit objective. 
When they succeed, they create jobs, employing more and more people as they
grow, and they raise the standard of living in the direct, healthy sense of
providing liquid cash to people in exchange for work. They're (ideally and
mostly) _meritocratic_ as well, in the sense that people with demonstrable
skills and knowledge tend toward promotion, and salaries are based on
responsibility (businesses _give_ more according to responsibility, while
Government _takes_ more according to income). 

Government, on the other hand, spreads an umbrella over the entirety of its
citizens. You can't "quit" government, unless you expatriate. It
also&mdash;and unlike business&mdash;exersizes a specifically moral activity in
that it is with government that fundamental notions of fairness are given action
with policy. Government, in this sense, plays more the role of a parent or
family to its citizens than business ever can. Which is why Acton's caution
ought to be heeded all the more: power does indeed corrupt, and absolute power
(read: Government) corrupts absolutely. 

To review the point: Government's relation to people tends to be comprehensive
in a way that business cannot be. It tells us whether we should wear helmets
when we ride bicycles, how many drinks are acceptable before driving, how much
income we ought to give back for the public good (a term which is, of course,
interpreted by Government itself), what we ought to eat, what the penalties for
various infractions are, and on and on and on. Its natural tendency as an
institution is to act in a parental manner, instructing us in various ways,
shaming and prodding us into various behaviours, and slapping our wrists when we
do otherwise. Much of this control is of course necessary (I'm well aware), but
the present point remains. Pejorative phrases like "Nanny State" for an over
reaching government are apt. 

So the full point is: because of the tendency for Government to reach into 
_every aspect of human life_ , this particular institution tends much more
toward absolute corruption then businesses existing under the umbrella of
governments can ever manage. We ought, therefore, to heed Acton's warning
accordingly. We shouldn't grow Government gleefully, we should find ways to
limit it. 

Now, for some reason completely lost on me, many of us never get this. 
Liberals&mdash;and I have many Liberal friends, and they are otherwise quite
intelligent&mdash;recoil instinctively at the suggestion that we ought to treat
Government with caution (although I've noticed that they're much more receptive
when Conservatives are in charge). They regard (Liberal) Government in almost
autonomic, unquestioning fashion, as the sole, singular force for good. This is
of course certainly the case in a properly circumscribed sense&mdash;I'd rather
not act as my own police force during a murderous riot&mdash;but without
qualification its absurd. Government is an institution that, as it grows
larger, tends naturally to reduce the autonomy of its citizens. How is this
good?

To conclude, Government's inertia, like all institutions with power, is 
_always_ toward more power, not naturally toward the good. And because the
relation between citizens and Government tends to be one of dependency (think
Welfare State), its thrust as a function of its size will tend to be away from
personal liberty and autonomy. It is, in this sense, a Bogey Man, although I'll
admit that it's one we certainly can't do without.

In some other post, I'll weigh in on the recent 700 billion bail out, and why I
think conservatives should have opposed it, with the hopes of both preserving
principle and benefiting in economic
practice.
