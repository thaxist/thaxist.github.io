One of the (many) unfortunate consequences of the Credit Crisis is its stalling
effect on some very sensible alternative energy plans. The [Pickens
Plan](http://www.pickensplan.com/) , for one, which I support. The first phase
of PP is wind energy; unfortunately Mr. Pickens, who wrote a book titled "The
First Billion is the Hardest", now can't get financing for the project.

The New York Times reports also that Centrica, a British company, has halted
expansion of its offshore wind farms project due to economic woes.

And with the price of crude plummeting, the sense of urgency for energy reform
is all but gone. The OPEC yo-yo
continues.
