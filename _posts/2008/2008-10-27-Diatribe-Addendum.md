Clarification: "spreading the wealth" does not equal "progressive income
taxation"...

Just in case anyone has this straw man in mind. Here's why: _spreading the
wealth_ means, point blank, _from the rich, to the poor_ . It's direct income
redistribution. Wealth spreading is different than simply _taking a greater
share from those who have more_ , which is progressive taxation. 

Progressive taxation seeks greater tax revenues by taking more money from those
who have plenty. Flat taxers will argue the fairness of this as well (see my
prior 
[post](http://thethaxis.blogspot.com/2008/10/flat-tax-or-whats-next-stoning.html)
), but as a strategy for tax revenue generation, it's been pretty roundly
adopted by advanced economies, and it has shown itself to be fairly resilient to
charges of obvious unfairness.

On the other hand, this business of wealth redistribution is much more
contentious, particularly in America. It moves directly from tax revenues from
the wealthy to more _income_ to the poor: from those who have more, directly
to those who have less. So, the "Marxist" or "Communist" charges we've heard
blurted around the fringes of the McCain campaign, while clearly incendiary and
political (in the pejorative sense), are not without a certain _tout court_ 
plausibility.

All this said, politicians talking to scary looking dudes like "Joe the Plumber"
might occasionally choose less-than-optimal phrases to convey their meaning; I'm
happy to assume that Obama is not&mdash;in any real sense&mdash;some Trojan
Horse Marxist. More likely, he'd like to help some of the middle class by using
tax revenue from members of the upper class. We're already doing this, with
varying degrees of success. We'll see, if Obama is elected, if he's got the
right strategy to make it succeed with American voters. _They'll be baaaack_ ,
in what may seem like a long or a very short four years. With a Democratic
House and Senate alongside an Obama administration, if it's a long four we'll
all know exactly who to blame. Right or wrong, the pendulum swingeth, and it
surely will swingeth
again.
