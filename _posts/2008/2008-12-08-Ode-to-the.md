I have been traveling since Tuesday and hence no time for posting. But on my
return there's my _leetle friend_ , the Smith and Wesson Model 629 .44 Magnum
(my wife picked it up from the gun shop while I was gone).

A few comments, in no particular order (actually a false statement; clearly
there's a _particular order_ , so hear it here first: all these years folks
have been fibbing about the non-particularity of their particular orders).

1. It weighs as much as a kitchen pot half full of water.

2. The chambers are so large that I can get a good portion of my pinky finger
into them.

3. Pointing it at yourself in the mirror gives you the heebee geebees (even,
obviously, when verifiably unloaded).

4. It's barrel-heavy, with the 6" barrel. Tweaks the wrist a bit. The 6" barrel
is I think shortest allowable for hunting. Moose. Or bear. It's _Palin
Friendly_ as we now say.

5. The grip is slightly small, although not unreasonably so.

6. It seems for all the world like a gun of such heft that one could make a
plausible case that even absent ammo, it could still function as a formidable
weapon.

7. My mother-in-law likes it.
Really.
