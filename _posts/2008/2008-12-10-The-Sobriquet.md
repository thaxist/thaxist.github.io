She remained **phlegmatic** about her **sobriquet** long after her lover had
bestowed it, and then began using it in earnest. But something changed. She
noticed first that she was anxious to discuss it when around the table with her
girlfriends, and later became horrified at the prospect of its slipping to third
parties in public or semi-public moments. She was not a woman prone to 
**obloquy** , particularly against her lover, but in almost **febrile** 
moments she began to fret that he had drawn her into a **miasma** of his
silly, **redolent** , **refulgent** phrases that he thought **coruscated** 
their union and she just his style. She didn't know any more. She thought
maybe she didn't like her **sobriquet** . Maybe she _hated it._ 

**Exiguous** complaints, she countered. And then the frustration would grow
until it burst out in **fissiparous** fragments, and she'd retreat to lying
motionless. Unthinking. 

In other moments a more **psephological** mood would emerge, and she'd poll
her constant and contradictory thoughts for some majority that might bring
solace. Or decision. 

Decision. **Dissumulation** , is all. **Dissumulation** . He doesn't care,
despite his near ubiquitous **plaudits** . _Well nor than does she._ It
was, she later realized, the **codicil** that granted her immunity from that
death which awaited the other. She was **phlegmatic** no
more.
