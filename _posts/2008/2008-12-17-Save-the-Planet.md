Gore thinks he's [saving the
planet](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/3726003/Al-Gore-World-cares-more-about-Paris-Hilton-than-saving-the-planet.html)
. I love this. The hubris. Most of us can't save our sandwich from getting
stale on the corners. But Gore's got us frothed up about saving the planet. 
Well, hell, let's do it Al (say this in a slow Southern drawl). Let's save it
mo fo. What to do first? How about, with every last penny, mobilize our forces
to scare the beejeesus out of China, until they stop building [those 1950s coal
plants](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews) . 
That'd do a heckuva lot. Failing that, I'll put in those energy saving bulbs (I
do use these, actually, but only because it makes good financial sense). How
many flourescent bulbs does it take to cancel out a coal plant? Have to start
somewhere, I
guess.
