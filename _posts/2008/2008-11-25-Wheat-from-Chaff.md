Okay, after getting sucked into the vortex of the damnable Global Warming
debate, I’ll attempt a few additional points (see “Global Cooling” comments for
the latest salvo of belief vs. skepticism).

One, by “Global Warming” (or just “GW”), I’m referring not to the obvious notion
that the climate is changing but to the current view that the average measured
temperature of the Earth will continue to rise to the point where we witness
massive, even catastrophic changes in our climate. Now the “Al Gore” version of
GW—which seems most popular—is the following. One, the ice caps melt. Two, the
ocean levels rise. Three, human habitation (especially in coastal areas) is
threatened by widespread flooding from the rising oceans. (Add into the mix
other effects, such as an increase in extreme weather events.)

Okay, I’m sure the GW folks can add to this, or correct it in any number of ways
they see fit. I think it’s a reasonable stab at the basic scenario that lights
the we-must-do-something-now fire under GW proponents.

Now, there is I think a lot of confusion out there about science; to be more
precise, about our ability to _predict the future_ using the tools of science. 
We'll have to dig into some details to cash this out. First, the Enlightenment
did indeed give us powerful predictive abilities that apply to what I'll call 
_classical systems_ ; systems that are not inherently complex. The standard
classical examples involve the prediction of celestial events (when will the
comet appear in the night sky, when will the shuttle approach the moon?, etc.).
Our mathematics works really well for these types of systems. But in messier,
complex systems (the so-called "nonlinear" systems that can't easily be modeled
by differential equations, but enough of this), our predictive powers are
positively paltry. 

Not convinced? Consider: We can't give 7 day weather forecasts to save our
backsides (in Central Texas, we can hardly get 2-3 day forecasts), we can't tell
where the hurricane will make landfall (the predictive models give us 25
different trajectories, and whadya know, one of them was close!). We can't tell
whether the Northeast will have heavy snow in 2009, and on and on. This is the
dirty little secret about complex systems. We can't see into their future. And
the global weather patterns of the Earth, folks, are a complex system. 

So, at this point, the GW folks get red faced, and tell me that I'm screwing up
the planet (sometimes they tell me that I'm almost ethically suspect, a sure
sign that politics is wrapped too tightly around science). And here's my
rejoinder: we don't know, and I suspect that _you_ know that we don't know,
but you're terrified that the knuckle draggers around you won't act quickly
enough unless you make the issue seem dire, and requiring immediate attention. 
You trade the healthy skepticism about our predictive powers for some assurance
that our kids won't inherit a world with Mel Gibson in it (I mean, in The Road
Warrior). And so, over and over I hear: _well, maybe we're wrong, but the
cost of us not acting as if we're right is too great._ It's Pascal's Wager (to
which William James once remarked that God should throw out of heaven the
Pascal's Wager believers first...).

And my response is: look, reducing carbon emissions is a classic case of 
_over-determination_ (as philosophers like to put it). We all want clean air,
clean water, parks to take our kids, a reduction in dangerous foreign oil, and
so on. We have so many reasons to aggressively pursue alternative energy
sources, who needs to leap headlong into (I think) suspect claims about our new
found abilities to predict the future behavior of complex systems? Who needs
the almost religious it-must-be-right fervor about some theory that is hotly
debated and which, in spite of the GW rhetoric, is really still murky (I think).
 Let's get all the benefits of a cleaner future while maintaining a healthy
skepticism about our ability to _see into the future_ . Because, with complex
systems, we can't. 

So, sorry Al (Gore), but the world doesn't need more fear-mongering. We need
less. And we can make the world a better place without
it.
