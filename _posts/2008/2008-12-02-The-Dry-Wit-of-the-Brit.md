Chistopher Hitchens, you gotta love this guy. He's on Hardball last night with
Salon's Joan Walsh debating the Hilary Clinton pick, a perfect platform to
launch his everything-but-the kitchen-sink diatribes against the Clintons (he
thinks _very little_ of the Clintons, I'm now aware). Ms. Walsh, who
apparently was there as a cheerleader for Clinton (needed only the pom poms),
and now has a look on her face like Mr. Hitchens is talking about her sister
(the camera keeps panning over to her, what high drama), has just about enough
and, without engaging the substance of his charges, lobs a Labowski at him:
"that's just your opinion Christopher." To which he retorts "...yes, how
clever, and look who's saying it? Would you rather I give your opinion?" Walsh
just kind of harumphs, but Mathews couldn't resist a chuckle. Neither could
I.
