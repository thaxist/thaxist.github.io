I really wish Fox News would stop using "homicide bomber" to describe [suicide
bombings](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,458786,00.html) . For one, it's
redundant. If we know that a bomber kills 12 in Iraq, we already know that there
was a homicide. Just say "Bomber kills 12 ..." and be done with it. Two, the
"suicide" modifier adds information about the nature of the bombing; it tells us
that in fact the bomber was also and intentionally killed by his detonation of
the bomb. That tells us something new. Fox, please, stop munging the language in
a dreadfully obvious attempt to place emphasis on those killed by the bomber. No
such linguistic machinations are required. I'm sure your viewers will not be
tempted, even remotely, to sympathize with _the bomber_ , at the expense of the
innocent people brutally killed. You can go ahead and use the language
correctly; it'll be all
right.
