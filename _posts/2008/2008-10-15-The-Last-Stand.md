McCain might still win if he warms to Obama, looking at him sincerely and
showing him palpable respect as a worthy adversary. His downward trend tracks
interestingly with his increasing "grumpy, I don't have to listen to you"
demeanor. Change agents&mdash;real change agents&mdash;tend to be remarkable
human beings as well. _A fortiori_ encumbents who run on change must also run
on some large, evident quality of humanness&mdash;of intelligent
sensitivity&mdash;that provides the public confidence that makes all else
possible.
