What happened to Global Warming? To the planet "having a fever", as Gore in his
arguably more inconvenient than truthful oratory impressed upon us? Apparently
we have bigger fish to fry now (with, of course, non-carbon emitting heat
sources). The economic meltdown, for instance. More powerful than a
war-on-terror, which, apparently, wasn't enough to keep the feverish planet out
of the lime light. Not so the Credit Crisis.

So, perhaps, it's a good time to revisit what I've long suspected is an entirely
suspect political/scientific _cause du jour_ .

Plenty of facts to bore everyone to tears, but let me instead explain the type
of argument that Global Warming seems to inspire. It goes a little like this...

First, we have scientific data. We have charts. We make the case. But next,
inconveniently, some really smart people (e.g., professors at MIT) disagree. 
They have different data, or see the existing data differently, and draw, with
MIT rigorousness, entirely non-Global Warming conclusions. 

Now, when confronted with these nay sayers&mdash;and for no apparent political
reason do they nay say (unless, perhaps, they wish to disintegrate their
careers, for some unknown future benefit)&mdash; the GW crowd goes democratic: 
"Well, most, indeed nearly all, of the scientists cut the political cake our
way. There's consensus. We voted, and we won." More scientists said what they
wanted them to say. 

That's fine, but science is hardly a show of hands. Its evidence based. Just
one well-informed person (expert) with something to say, ought to be heard,
whether contradicting the bandwagon or not. Maybe he'll get less research
money. But, if he or she is doing _science_ , and if GW is so obviously right,
it ought to be just easy then to rebut the dissenting view. Just prove the
irritating dissenter wrong, if the theory is so obviously right. No need to 
_vote_ . That sounds like politics. We didn't vote on General Relativity, after
all. It just _is_ , as any physicist will tell you. 

_The GW debate is so far from over, it just astounds me that its near-religious
proponents want so desperately to slam the lid shut._ I've heard mamby-pamby
justifications for this non-scientific attitude like "Well, even if we're wrong,
and there's not imminent catastrophic climate change, we should do something
about our emissions." Yes, yes, yes. Of course. We should also import less
foreign oil. Sounds like a win-win to me too, but lets do science _as science_
. It's not pragmatism or policy, after all; it's supposed to be the search for
truth. Let's find it, if we can. 

At any rate, and to return, the Gore-scare seems to be largely over, for now,
replaced by the Credit-scare. And so, if something needed to be done _now_ to
fix Global Warming (I mean Gore-now, right now!), we're either completely insane
(worrying about this credit crisis crap), or less susceptible to b.s. than some
would hope. An inconvenient truth,
perhaps.
