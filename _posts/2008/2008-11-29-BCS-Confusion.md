Texas Tech beats Texas in a Hail Mary pass to Crabtree with a second left. They
then implode against the Sooners, and the surging Sooners now beat OSU in the
"Bedlam" matchup in Stillwater, 61-41. Now, a three-way tie for the Big 12
Championship game. BCS rankings decide, with the Longhorns holding a slim
advantage over the Sooners. Tech, who struggled against Baylor today, winning
by 7 (Tech 35, Baylor 28), is probably out of contention for the national title,
and with the Sooners victory in Stillwater they are definitively out of the Big
12 Championship.

So, the BCS rankings decide between Texas and Oklahoma. Although there is no
rule against, it is nonetheless an unwritten "rule" that teams who fail to
secure conference titles are not voted into the BCS title game. So, if the
Sooners pull ahead of Texas later today, the Longhorns are likely out of the
national title hunt. Unless, perhaps, the Sooners drop the Big 12 matchup to
Mizzou. But don't count on it. If that unlikely event happened, my guess is
that no team from the Big 12 South would go. Maybe then the winner of the SEC
championship (Alabama or Florida) would end up matched against... USC?

Let's hope the voters keep in mind that Texas beat the Sooners this season, on
neutral ground, 45-35. Hook
em'.
