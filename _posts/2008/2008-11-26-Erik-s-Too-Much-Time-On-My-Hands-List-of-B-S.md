1. Bigfoot. Not real.

2. The Lochness Monster. Not real.

3. Alien abductions. Never happened. Ever. To anyone.

4. Aliens flying in spacecraft, visiting Earth. Also B.S.

5. This CEO salary thing. Successful Fortune 500 CEO, 10 million a year. 
Oprah Winfrey, 275 million a year. What the heck? Why isn't Oprah _27.5 times
more evil_ ? B.S.

6. Bill Maher. Joker. Rich joker.

7. The idea that the "war on terror" is over. What, we're so giddy in Obamaland
that we think the Evil Doers have _term limits_ ? B.S.

8. GW. I mean "Great White", the 1980s rock band. For the fire in the
nightclub deal.

9. Teatotallers. Unless you're someone who imbibes and ends up in a tree 50
miles from home, with no recollection of how you got there. And you're
surrounded by cops. (Actually, I think this happened to me once. But it wasn't
cops, it was midgets, or "little people". Or whatever.)

10. _Certain aspects_ of holidays. Maybe, The Holiday
Season.
