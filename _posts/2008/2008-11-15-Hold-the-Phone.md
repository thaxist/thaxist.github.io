For anyone who remembers the foundering hopelessness of Democrats after
President Bush's reelection in 2004, after the simultaneously stentorian and
soporific John Kerry failed to deliver, we'd all be wise to take a chill pill
before [expatiating on the death of the Republican
party](http://www.salon.com/opinion/kamiya/2008/11/11/republicans/index.html) . 
 

American politics is cyclical, like democratic politics generally; back and
forth between our two parties we always go. No need to dig deep into history
tomes to get this, just read Wikipedia entries for a few minutes about past
elections and it'll become clear. The elephant will return; I hope thoroughly
modernized and with a clear, inclusive message that resonates and especially
inspires. 

At any rate, even if President-elect Obama is a two-termer (of course way too
early to prognosticate about this), it's hardly that long in the wilderness for
those roaming Dinosaur Republicans, when put in historical context. So, enjoy
the moment, Salon. But chill. You don't want some new era of journalistic
gloaters to dig up those now-embarassing backlogged 2008 articles, injecting
them with glee into future discussions about Republican reemergence. Back and
forth we
go.
