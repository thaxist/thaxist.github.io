I have a puzzle about [Global
Warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) ! (I'm now including the
exclamation to further capture the added drama that typically attends the
phrase). It's the observation that C02 levels have, in times past, been high,
yet the climate then was actually cooling. In other words, the temp graph was 
_trending down_ as the carbon dioxide levels were _trending up_ . The GW folks
have some ready made explanations for this, mostly centered on the catch-all
"it's complicated" dismissal (translation: you stupid skeptics, you're either
not scientific or just plain crazy!), with perhaps some additional whiz-bang
sciency sounding stuff about how A, B, C, and sometimes D can vary with levels
of This, That, and The Other. Don't worry about all of this, however. Just
remember that _it's complicated_ . And butt out. (Of course, _it's
complicated_ should stick to the GW believers as much as to the skeptics. 
_It's complicated_ is double-edged, after all.)

This debate, whenever I've had enough of the Dark Knight (will this movie ever
end?) and I'm thinking about something that fires everyone up, but that smells
like a three day old fish, I always end up back at Global Warming! And when the
discussion ping pongs back and forth long enough to exhaust the easy points and
counter points, we inevitably end up back at "But what are the costs of
inaction?" (no, this isn't the runup to the Iraq War all over again). As if
we'll all be for coal plants and China and pollution and Hummers unless we
believe that we can predict the future of the weather.

I will end me post with this however: if anyone can tell me what the weather
will be like in a few decades, I'd like to discuss the stock market. You might
just be my best
friend.
