[In memoriam](http://www.michaelcrichton.net/) . This is a strangely emotional
post. First, some facts. Of his works, I've read, in order: The Andromeda
Strain, Terminal Man, Travels (an autobiographical sketch). After a long period
of snooty academia, returned to Next, Airframe (read while I was taking flying
lessons, still my favorite), Prey, State of Fear, Timeline, and started on
Disclosure (but, I have to confess, my flame had begun to die out by then...).

Years ago, after graduating college, I purchased a used motorcycle, mapped out a
(rough) course of thousands of miles from Spokane, to Seattle, down to Los
Angeles, and then into the Rocky Mountains. I left by myself, and was gone for
a sizable portion of that summer. Weeks later I was somewhere in Colorado, on
the lawn of some roadside house near Craig, reading Crichton's Travels. Alone,
and _lonely_ and _happy_ (travelers will know this paradox well enough). 
Broke down, waiting on the benevolence of a stranger; parts for my motorcycle. 

Mr. Crichton was with me on this journey, through so many dark nights. I read
his Travels, I picked it up and smelled it and put it back in my backpack, and
picked it up again. He was there in the tent pitched in deserted campgrounds or
just wind-swept BLM land, where I would travel down some unmarked dirt road
looking for a place to pitch a tent for the night, racing against shadows that
grew darker and stitched together until I had nothing but blackness. He was
there when I made it, dehydrated and alone, to Lake Havasu from Los Angeles. I
read him at 9,000 feet in the Colorado Rockies, and in the plains of Wyoming,
and then Yellowstone, and Montana. After weeks of being alone, I would cry at
night (in a manly way, of course...), and I would read... Crichton. It's all
intermingled now, inextricably, in my memories and emotions.

And so I, like so many others, had a connection to Crichton's works, in the
physical sense that I took _his_ autobiography with me on my own travels those
years ago. (I took also "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", which was
lost in a poorly fastened backpack on the second day of the trip. Someone from
near Wenatchee, Wa actually mailed it back to me weeks later. It's still
Travels&mdash;and not by happenstance, I don't think&mdash;that captures the
sentiment of my own travels.)

I had also a connection to Michael Crichton years later, which is to say
recently, in a more intellectual sense: I've been stimulated by his points about
technology and science in his latest novels (for instance, when he cast a
scientist's scepticism on catastrophic climate change in his 2002 "State of
Fear"). 

Michael Crichton, I don't know why you died so young. I wish it were not. 
We're all, of course, just suddenly gone, and _in memoriam_ for those who knew
us too. But the past memories of my adventurous self, with my copy of your
Travels to comfort me, literally, under the light of a lantern, lying by myself
in wilderness thousands of miles from anyone I knew, or could count on; I was
comforted by your presence. I'm sorry to see you go. Good bye, Mr. Crichton. 
And thank
you.
