... is about as far from an objective journalist as you can find in mainstream
media. If an alien, completely unbiased, would observe the press long enough to
understand... I'm sure he'd (she'd, it'd) classify Olbermann and Sean Hannity
together. Two non-objective people talking at us, if we care to listen.

Case in point: Olbermann's [bizarre
declamation](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)
of a Sept. 11 tribute during the Republican National Convention. To the extent
that I understand his decidedly non-journalistic dramatism, I guess the
implication he'd like us to draw is that the Republicans are wrong-headed and
somehow morally stained, in a way that disqualifies them from talking about
events such as Sept. 11; certainly from paying any tribute to this event during
their convention. If this isn't partisan whacky from the so-called press...
what is? No wonder MSNBC yanked him from journalistic duties (rumours that Tom
Brokaw had some part in this). Anyway, as I said, it's Hannity, MSNBC style. 
For those viewers out there who treat politics like a sports contest (may my
side win, no matter what!), I'm sure Olbermann delivers.

So, what gave rise to this whole _just before bed tirade_ is my unfortunate
viewing tonight of a Olbermann's latest Countdown. Consistently, conspicuously,
it's always "Mr. Bush" on this episode, never "President" Bush (even if he is?).
 So the language is, over and over, "President-elect Obama", meeting with "Mr.
Bush". Excuse me, but isn't "Mr. Bush" our current _President_ ? And, if so,
isn't "President Bush" the proper nomenclature? Apparently not. But to put a
happy face on things, I'm sure _President-elect Obama_ had a fine time with
this _Mr. Bush_ fellow (I hope Mr. Bush didn't talk too long, or waste
President-elect Obam's time); perhaps they discussed how Mr. Bush could some day
run for high office himself. 

Okay, point made. Here's the deal. I've always downgraded hard-core partisan
types, on the right or left. I suspect the 2000 presidential elections debacle
still rankles with Olbermann types (those partisan talking heads, I mean). But
there's nothing more we can ever do than let the process&mdash;judicial, local,
Supreme&mdash;take its course. President Bush was elected by this American
process. And he's not therefore illegitimate, unless so too was the process
itself, and its final arbiter. Perhaps there were flaws, in the details, or
perhaps not. But after the Supreme Court ended our hopes or fulfilled them,
what actions were left to us? A new revolution? Very American. But mostly
we're not much into real revolution these days; we prefer instead to grouse
endlessly. And at any rate we don't have time for it. For Mr. Olbermann, for
instance, it's got to be tricky to manage much more than partisan bickering when
hosting a lucrative hate-Bush segment on MSNBC. (A point not lost on me, being
a Capitalist.) 

To whit, we all get behind our President-elects after due process;
President-elect Obama's case was much easier, winning the popular and electoral
vote. But in a much closer and frustrating election, so too was our current
President sworn in by due process. Sorry that many didn't like the outcome. 
It's part of American politics that, every four years, predictably about half of
the voting public doesn't either. So get over it. We can disagree without
disrespect. It's _President_ Bush, _Mr._ Olbermann. That's
America.
