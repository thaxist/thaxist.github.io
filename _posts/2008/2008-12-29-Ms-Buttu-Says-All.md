This [Hamas Israel
thing](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD95CON280)
. On CNN Rich Sanchez interviewed first the Israel ambassador to the UN, then
former PLO legal advisor Diana Buttu, to get both sides, you know. American
above-the-fray media. Wow. These folks know how to bicker. Screw the facts. 
Ms. Buttu, in response to Sanchez's question "But don't the Israelis have a
right to defend themselves?", makes a couple of interesting points, that I'll
take the time to dissect.

One, the rocket attacks from Hamas didn't have "explosive heads", unlike the
Israeli rockets.

Oh, yes, Ms. Buttu, you went to law school to say that? Nice. As if Hamas was
mindful of Israeli lives, pulling off the war heads from the rockets before
lobbing them willy-nilly into civilian neighborhoods, soccer fields, etc. 
Wouldn't want to unduly injure anyone. Is she serious? I'm pretty sure if
Hamas had a Number 2 pencil with a nuclear tip they'd figure out a way to
smuggle it into an Israeli grade school in hopes of exterminating some Jewish
children. Give me a break.

The reality is, Hamas is literally throwing missiles into civilian areas of
Israel _in hopes of killing anyone_ . And Ms. Buttu, you know it. Shame on
you. I'll be nice and merely give you the dumb ass comment of the year award.

Two, this lobbing of missiles into civilian neighborhoods is justified, because
Israel has been waging a Nazi-like war against Palestinians, with military
missions into Gaza, having the effect of cruelly denying Palestinians their
freedom (how does _that_ work?) Man, it sounds bad. But let me sum it up for
those uninitiated into the perpetual Palestinian-Israel conflict: _the Jews
intend to live here_ ! And they have a military! And they use it when we try
to slaughter them! Damn Israel! Damn them when they strike back! 

Great. So the best I can tell from Ms. Buttu's comments is that, after her
barrage of legalistic, emotive words, the reality is that Israel is actually
trying to be a sovereign nation in the Middle East, and it patrols the borders
of the Gaza Strip, and actually intends not to perish but to try to insure the
security of its citizens.

This conflict, if an alien were to come down and hear both sides of it
dispassionately, would so far skew in favor of Israel's targeted strikes in
reaction to the mayhem-intending Hamas actions that "hearing both sides" would
become a joke. There's no equivalence, and the world knows it. _Hamas hates
the Jews._ And how dare _the Jews_ try to live near Hamas (or in the Middle
East generally). Sanchez did his best to hear both sides; in the end, what I've
said here is just exactly what both sides said. Sans perhaps the
legaleeze.
