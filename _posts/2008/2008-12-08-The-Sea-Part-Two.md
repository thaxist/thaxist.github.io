The undulations of the sea lofted him up, and rolled him helplessly down, into
the chaotic brine and ocean. He choked. He choked more. His eyes went wide as
adrenaline surged, his limbs flailing, then a massive push down into the sea. 
The spots that grew red in his consciousness grew brighter; his mind reeled and
he was strangely cognitive, caught in frantic vascilating between drawing
breaths of air or clenching shut to stem so much more choking. He didn't get it
right. Water came into his lungs with fantastic pain and no air. No air. He
drew in on himself. Where was he? Suddenly, and quit unexpectedly an insight. 
 _It should be fine_ , he thought, suprised at his calmness. Calm. That's what
he was forgetting. Calm brought his dreams and his thoughts and then the
painless morphinic images where he saw his father. His father was smiling,
looking at him. God, his whole life washed over with calm. He was fine. He
had always been fine. 

The boulder that struck his head got no prize. He had ceased to care, and then
he knew no more. 

His death lay heavy on the hearts of the living. It was perplexing, and tragic.
Perhaps. But perhaps _in no one's view in particular_ , it could be said that
his last moments were in fact very much like his first moments, and strangely
just so innocent and divine. There was, of course, no one there to say
it.
