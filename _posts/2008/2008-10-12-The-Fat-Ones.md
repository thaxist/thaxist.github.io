The bellies and backsides of Northerners expand during the Winter months, as a
rule; there isn't much to do outside in the snow and cold, for most of them, and
so they catch minor bouts of log cabin fever, eating sweets as a surrogate for
outside activities, drinking hot chocolate, and watching too much T.V.
Southerners are afflicted with just the opposite bug: during the hot, humid
dog-days of a Southern summer, they crank the A.C., drink too much alcohol and
lemonade, and generally come out only to barbeque, when the sun has receeded and
the temperature begins its lazy descent to two digits
again.
