Donald Trump gets interviewed, pretty frequently, by cable news for sound bites
on what's happening with the economy, business, banking, this kind of thing. You
know, _The Donald_ topics. Well I really do love these Donald moments. This is
a guy who once ran for President, promoting himself to the country with
memorabilia like "I've had a great time here" (what the heck does that mean? Is
this what-happens-in-Vegas campaigning? Sounds like a Chicago politician, with
perhaps less criminality and more just standard issue _louche_ ).

So he's back on cable news now, giving his wisdom on the auto bailout. The
problem with The Donald is that he's so opulently wealthy, so New York Cosmo
privileged, that he can't manage the relevant distinctions for us plebian
viewers. When asked if he'd buy an American car, he responds that he's got
several. In fact, he says, he just had one of his workers buy a Dodge Ram truck
for him. He likes Cadillacs, too. Buick makes a good car, he assures us. 

The interviewer, Greta Van Suster-whatever, asks if he buys foreign as well, and
she should have known better, because (say it with me) of course he does! He
buys them all. See, it's just about Donald Trump being _really rich_ . But
strangely I still like the guy. He embodies that rarified world of gaudy New
York real estate tycoons. He's (weirdly) innocently _just that_ . He tells us
with a straight face that he helps the struggling economy by _buying expensive
things_ (he's got, strictly speaking, something of a point here.) No time for
philanthropic B.S., The Donald's making deals. He just scored another gold
statue for one of his homes. Beautiful. Great time to buy em'. 

Final thought, The Donald was on I think MSNBC a while back, and was asked about
buying real estate. I kid you not, he's on point with a story about how he just
picked up a piece of real estate for pennies on the dollar. 112 million is all.
 It's a great time to buy, he concludes (as if we should all rush out and grab
up some resorts in Miami for cheap). The interviewer is slightly exasperated at
this point and reminds Mr. Trump that many Americans are struggling to buy a
first home, or pay the mortage on an existing. Unfazed. The deals are out
there, he says. And they are. If you're The
Donald.
