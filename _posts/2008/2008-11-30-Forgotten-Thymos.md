We have, mainly, two great axes today upon which modern explanations of social
phenomena turn. One, the economic/Marxist reduction; two, the religious/secular
dichotomy, the latter a distinction which has carried such a load of late that
it is in danger of spilling out and spoiling everyone's complacency.

A third analysis of _why we do what we do_ comes from German philosopher Hegel,
who plucked from Ancient Greece the tripartite conception of the person (reason,
desire, and thymos). It is the thymos, he said, that drives history. Thymos is
roughly _the desire to be recognized_ . It's what makes us feel shame. Or
pride. It is rooted in a conception of human freedom that is, at bottom, the
notion that we are not understood completely by desires or by reason (roughly,
by Marx or by Enlightenment secularism). The thymotic urge is a warriors urge,
in us all, and finds its basic expression in the willingness to _risks one's
life to prove that one is free_ . Animals, when thirsty, just drink. People
have the ability to delay desire, and they have the ultimate capacity to
demonstrate that they are not animals by risking their lives (in modern times,
we can cash this out as "dying for symbols of freedom", like medals, or honors).

Unfortunately I'm travelling tomorrow and have (true to form) hardly packed or
even gotten my hotel room yet, so I can't burrow into this to the depth that it
deserves.

Suffice it for now to say that the modern mind, trying to fit _bad things
around us_ into either an economically disadvantaged model (Marx) or a
whacky-religious model (Enlightenment), is I think inadequate. What they want,
and what makes them feel so alive, and so much better than the desiring "last
men" who no longer care about honor but just material comforts before they too
perish from the Earth, is _recognition_ . How to change the debate such that
they can have it, is surely worth talking
about.
