Has anyone noticed that politicians, pundits, and just about anyone on the T.V.
or air waves now refers to "Americans" as "the American people"? It's
everywhere now. [Bush](http://www.kentucky.com/473/story/559362.html) isn't
immune (though also not exclusive). Nor 
[McCain](http://nptelegraph.com/articles/2008/10/19/news/50000889.txt) . Or 
[Obama](http://www.barackobama.com/2008/09/18/unite_the_american_people.php) . 
Why? What's wrong with the succinct, and perfectly adequate&mdash;in the sense
of referring to what's intended&mdash;"Americans" moniker?

Maybe it's a silly question. Maybe the talking heads just need some lexical
variety. But I'll take the bait. I'll suspect otherwise. Here's how I propose
to develop the suspicion:

Used by itself (that is, as a noun, not an adjective), "American" seems to have
become a _loaded_ word&mdash;it now carries with it some cultural baggage that
might at any time backfire, with terrifying social consequences (he's not a 
_real_ American, or that's an attitude typical of an _American_ , or I'm proud
to be an _American_ ... this last a statement which, when uttered with a
country music twang, is equivalent to pronouncing yourself an ignoramus...). On
the other hand, "the American people", well, that's just the smart, hard working
humans who happen to live and work in the United States of America. They're
not, for gosh sakes, _Americans_ ! How vulgar! They're just those _citizens_
 out there. Members of the set of American citizens. Ahh yes, the slow,
steady, creepy creep of political correctness. Could it be? Could it be!

Well, until we get it sorted out, do feel free to proclaim: " _I'm proud to be a
member of the American people!_ " (although you'll sound like a geek for doing
it); this is immune to any backlash that simply proclaiming yourself an American
might invite. (I have, however, heard rumors that this may itself get further
modified to allow only a reference to being a member of a set of humans living
in North America, between Canada and Mexico. Will confirm if true.) But, to
return. At all costs, go easy on the singular _American_ label, please. 
Don't be vulgar.

Later it was reported that many heard, in the hallways, on the streets, the
resounding battle cry " _Members of the set of American people, unite!_ " 
Indeed. We have nothing to lose
but...
