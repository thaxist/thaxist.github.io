None, right now. I did purchase a Wired a while back, but in a section titled
"Here are three things we got wrong, 1993-2008", they cited Fukuyama's The End
of History. Among the more bone-headed claims I've seen in print lately, this
gem stands out:

"

Francis Fukuyama proclaimed that history ended with the demise of the Soviet
Union. The future would be characterized not by the literal but only the
figurative war of ideas. We believed him.

We were wrong. Wired failed to see how a new generation of fanatical geeks would
use the Internet in their effort to take over the world. Instead of ending,
history looped back on itself, and we are now confronted by a recrudescent and
particularly virulent religious ideology straight out of the Middle Ages.

We recognized a world in transition, but we missed the danger in front of us. We
eschewed conventional wisdom, but we couldn't escape it. Takeaway: Be
contrarian, and then be contrarian again.

"

Yes, that's the takeaway, you shiny paged, over glamorized pseudo-intellectual
gee whiz nitwits. That's precisely not what Fukuyama said. I'm sure he's
philosophical about getting misrepresented in the popular like-to-seem-smart
media. If I were him I'd laugh or cry, but kindly suggest to the editor of
Wired that they stick to GPS enabled toilet paper, laser sighted lipstick, and
whatever other techy auto-erotica adorn the pages of this unfortunate
'zine.
