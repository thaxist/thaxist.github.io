Ah, yes, the [flat tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_tax) . A substantive
idea with a panoply of economic data supporting its usefulness. It gets chucked
into a presidential campaign by a dude known to us, affectionately, as "Joe the
Plumber": the ultimate softball for the always eager to swing [Huffington
Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kelly/john-mccains-flat-tax-oct_b_135601.html)
. Huffington delivers the easy _ad hominem_ dismissal. I have a different
take. Contra Huffington, and digging deeper than Joe the Plumber's endorsement
(Joe, no fault to you), it's clear that the flat tax proposal has earned a place
in American politics and around the world generally. It has, and continues to
be, richly debated. Why is this so? Where Huffington offers only arrogant,
dismissive rhetoric, I'll take the time to explain.

Let's cash out the theory first. We go right to the meat of it with the notion
of fairness, or "justice".

Libertarian Philosopher King Robert Nozick offered a memorable picture of the
sort of fairness that undergirds the flat tax proposal, when he proposed the
following thought experiment. Imagine that there is some distribution of wealth
in the U.S. that we all accept as fair (call this, following the usual academic
love of unnecessary variables, D1). So, ex hypothesi, we all start with the
cash in our pockets that we all agree is fair; we start with distribution D1. 
Now suppose a celebrity (Nozick's example was the dated but still venerated Wilt
Chamberlain) decides that he or she wants more than D1, but proposes only to 
_allow people to choose how they spend their fair share_ . Now here's how it
happens. Loving our celebrity and his or her enrichening performances, many of
us end up freely contributing some portion of our fair share to enjoy the
performance, with the result that he or she ends up with more money than the
rest of us. 

This is to say, D1 no longer holds. The celebrity ended up with much more cash.

And this is exactly Nozick's point: D1&mdash; _we all agreed_ &mdash;was just. 
But we only _freely gave our share to others_ , with the result that our
celebrity ended up with more. So where did the injustice sneak in? Where did
it enter in? We all _freely parted_ with some of our wealth. But, ex
hypothesi, we all started with a fair distribution. So by the free exersize of
human interest, some of us ended up with more. Which is contrary to D1. And,
Nozick says, so much the worse for D1. Fair is fair.

What underlies this conception of justice is the notion that fairness is simply
equality of opportunity, rather than outcome. Nozickian fairness is fairness
that gaurantees that everyone can spend or create wealth according to their
interests and abilities. If this scheme&mdash;a scheme where people have
freedom to spend or create&mdash;ends up with inequalities of outcome (we ended
up giving our celebrity more gold), then so be it. The government ensured that
we could fairly exersize our interests using our resources; the outcomes are
however this works out. 

Great, but what, you may well be thinking at this point, does this have to do
with flat tax proposals? Here's how it works. Government needs some of your
money, in order to perform the functions of government (e.g., provide for
defense), but it doesn't take more from you because you have more. Fair is: a
certain percentage of your money goes to the government, according to the rules
we've agreed (voted) on. If you happen to be the celebrity, it's not the
business of government to take this into account when it comes time to pay
taxes. Bully for you, celeb. You ended up with your gold however you did.
(Forget, for our purposes here, questions such as what to do with inherited
wealth, or we'll never get through this.) Government doesn't care if others
gave you more gold. _It only sets a rate that it taxes, and demands that you
pay taxes at that rate._ It's blind, by design, to your own particular
wealth-accumulating accomplishments. On the Nozick line, that's what "fair"
means.

In contrast, equality of outcome theorists such as John Rawls (and many others)
consider, well, outcomes. Do we all end up with a fair distribution of
resources, regardless of how we started? To Rawlsians, inequalities of wealth
are _ipso facto_ examples of unfairness, because "fair" means aiming for
equality of outcome. (This is, of course, at loggerheads with the "opportunity"
camp, and one might insightfully conclude at this point that the two views of
fairness are incommensurable. The fact that such discussions in America tend to
ground out in incommensurability is a troubling fissure in our intellectual
landscape. The problem has been discussed at length by others, notably
philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre in his seminal 1980s work "After Virtue", but as
weighty philosophical discussions typically go, it hasn't percolated up into
discussions of policy, as I think it should.)

But back to the flat tax. The pressing point is that Huffington Post types,
either ignorant or uncaring of this rich philosophical discussion, simply act as
if Conservatives, like poor Joe the Plumber, spout out flat tax proposals
because they're either too dim witted or poorly educated to realize that it's 
_not fair_ . But as I hope I've shown, it depends on what you think fairness is
in the first place. How dare they presume that there's only one take on it.

Now, for some "praxis" to all this theory, it turns out that there are many
countries that have actually implemented a flat tax. I'm not a comparative
politics guy, and I'm well aware that the success or failure of particular
economies are the subject of much debate, but my point is simply that there 
_is_ a debate. It turns out that Joe the Plumber's not alone. To take one
example of a debatable flat tax success, consider Lithuania. Wikipedia has this
to say: 

"Lithuania, which levies a flat tax rate of 24% (previously 27%) on its
citizens, has experienced amongst the fastest growth in Europe. Advocates of
flat tax speak of this country's declining unemployment and rising standard of
living. They also state that tax revenues have increased following the adoption
of the flat tax, due to a subsequent decline in tax evasion and the Laffer curve
effect."

Sounds pretty dim witted to me. Again, I'm not claiming to be an expert on
Lithuania, or on flat tax policies in general for that matter. But my point is
simply this: knee jerk condemnations of particular tax proposals, like those
cheerily published by the Huffington Post, are not, shall we say, the paragon of
educated, liberal democratic discussion. It would be preferable, in my view,
for us to dig a little deeper before pulling the trigger on ridicule. Whatever
its ultimate merits, the flat tax is an idea that has played a key role in
intelligent debate from first-class thinkers far back into our history. 
Arguably, it also has been put to the empirical test by countries with, it would
seem, not so dim witted results. Maybe Joe the Plumber is on to
something.
