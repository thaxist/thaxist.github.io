I've always had a hard time with a literal intepretation of the many claims of
the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament is fraught with such difficulties
that I'll set it aside for now. But believing the claims made in the Gospels is
hardly an epistemic picnic either. "Jesus is God", that central tenet of
Christianity, is just hard for me to believe. I'm no skeptic of the historical
Jesus, but _God_ ? Really? And then there are the miracles (not just really
rare events, but supernatural interventions in the physical world). The list
goes on.

In addition to the basic problem of accepting these fantastical claims made in
religious texts dating back thousands of years, there's a kind of convoluted
quality to attempts by the early Church to makes sense of it all (and yet, it's
now accepted doctrine, not amenable any more to re-interpretation). For
instance, the Trinity. Do we really take seriously the three-in-one divinity
idea? It just all seems so _fishy_ .

For an insightful critique of organized religion try Sam Harris' The End of
Faith. Even if you disagree, it's a fresh angle on the place of ancient
religion in modern society, and it avoids the acerbic condescension of nit-wits
like Bill Maher. 

Finally, so I'm not misunderstood, and _contra_ Harris, I'm not an atheist. 
Also, I'm not _against the Church_ , whatever that would mean. I'd be
horrified if religious faith ever "ended" in Harris' sense. I like the insights
in his critique, but just not his conclusion. For one, organized religion
provides much non-government public benefit; it's a strong "mediating
institution" that stands between the State and individuals. Two, it's
community-based, in the "Bowling Alone" sense that it discourages the slide
toward selfish individualism. It brings people together. Three, the concept of
the Divine, whatever the doctrinal details, is I think right-headed and, for
lack of a better word, inspirational. I've never understood how Carl Sagan
types find such beauty and purpose in matter and energy. I'm no materialist.

Okay, I think that's enough for now. I'll leave things with a few anecdotes
from our political past. One, our own Benjamin Franklin, who was a lifelong
supporter of church, was friendly to and friends with clergy and all things
ecclesiastical, but nonetheless would spend Sunday "catching up on work" rather
than in the pew. Two, the great Winston Churchill, who helped save the free
world from the tyranny of fascism, once famously remarked that he was not so
much a pillar of the church but a buttress, supporting it from the outside. Now
that makes good sense to
me.
