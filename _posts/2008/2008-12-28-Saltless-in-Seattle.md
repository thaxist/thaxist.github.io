Seattle and in general the Pacific Northwest has been deluged this year with
snow. The enviro wizards in Sea-town managed to dump tons of sand all over the
streets to create traction for hapless motorists, a questionable tactic
motivated largely by the desire to avoid using salt. Too bad [sand is worse
for the environment than
salt](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008554976_roads24m.html) 
(but, doesn't it seem that _salt_ should be, well, worse than sand?). The
experts have proclaimed that salt "degrades marine life", while not offering
details. In the meantime, the six thousand _tons_ of sand dumped over Seattle
roadways are choking out the insect populations, negatively affecting local
streams. 
Damn.
