Everything is AI these days, especially face and voice recognition software.  Take [Jarvis](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/08/29/zuckerberg-may-debut-jarvis-ai-assistant-next-month/89566074/) Zuckerberg's latest public relations ploy, complete with stock quips about annoying his wife with gadgetry.  The prototype, named after the butler-voiced AI assitant worn by Tony Stark, aka "Iron Man," from the blockbuster movie series, controls Zuckerberg's home environment by translating his voice and location into commands, like changing room temperature, or opening a gate or door.

Fine.  Sure.  This kind of geek tech is cool (I suppose), but on a more serious note:  how is it "AI"?  A theme I'll be harping on in this blog is simply that no one really knows what AI is, in the first place.  It's trite anymore to say it's a buzzword, but underlying this insight is I think a deeper one:  why is a piece of computational technology "AI"?  The knee-jerk response I often hear is that AI is the automation of behavior or thinking that used to require the human brain.  Sure, like the desk calculator, as an astute reader pointed out recently in a prior post.  (After all, who can multiply large numbers in their head quickly?)

Kurzweil and other AI enthusiasts are quick to point out that AI is a moving target, as increasingly more and more of out intellectual lives are augmented or replaced by computation.  This is no doubt true (a truism), but it fails to explain anything.  Sure, voice recognition is getting better, and such capabilities were once the purview of human minds.  Well, so what?  So too with the calculator, playing checkers or chess, and so on.  It's entirely possible and indeed the commonsense view that such individual feats by algorithms prove nothing about the broader philosophical question of computers getting "minds" and becoming "intelligent."  What is "intelligence," anyway?  We call something smart that has a purpose, forms goals, and has some inner life so that meeting goals satisfies it, and failing to meet them frustrates it.  Performing algorithmic feats on multiplication, chess, or what have you isn't the same thing.  AI folks love to conflate such one-off performances by engineers using fast computation with genuine AI.  But it's all wishful thinking, and sci fi fuzzies.  Zuckerberg's "Jarvis" is AI, says he.  Sure.  But AI here is just the buzzword for something "cool"...

Any anyway, not everyone shares his gee-whiz enthusiasm for automating opening doors or changing room temperature.  Just ask his wife.
