Everything is AI these days, especially face and voice recognition software.  Take [Jarvis](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/08/29/zuckerberg-may-debut-jarvis-ai-assistant-next-month/89566074/) Zuckerberg's latest public relations ploy, complete with stock quips about annoying his wife with gadgetry.  The prototype, named after the butler-voiced AI assitant worn by Tony Stark, aka "Iron Man," from the blockbuster movie series, controls Zuckerberg's home environment by translating his voice and location into commands, like changing room temperature, or opening a gate or door.

Fine.  Sure.  This kind of geek tech is cool (I suppose), but how, exactly, is it "AI"?  A theme I'll be harping on in this blog is simply that no one really knows what AI is, in the first place.  It's effectively undefined, and so can be invoked anywhere there's a a sci-fi feel; it can mean anything.  It's passe these days to call AI a buzzword, but underlying this charge is I think a deeper, unanswered question:  why is a piece of computational technology "AI" in the first place?  The knee-jerk response I often hear is that AI is the reproduction of behavior or thinking that used to require the human brain.  Sure, like the desk calculator, as an astute reader pointed out recently in a prior post.  (After all, who can multiply large numbers in their head quickly?)

Kurzweil and other AI enthusiasts are quick to point out that AI is a moving target, as more and more of our intellectual lives are increasingly augmented or replaced by computation.  This is no doubt true (a truism), but it fails to explain anything.  Sure, voice recognition is getting better, and such capabilities were once the sole purview of human minds.  Well, so what?  The same could be said of the calculator, playing checkers or chess, and even in the not-too-distant future driving a car.  It's entirely possible and indeed the obvious, commonsense view that such individual feats by algorithms settle nothing about the broader philosophical question of computers getting "minds" and becoming "intelligent."

Cut to the chase:  what is "intelligence," anyway?  We call something intelligent that has a purpose, forms goals, and has some inner life so that meeting goals satisfies it, and failing to meet them frustrates it.  Performing algorithmic feats on multiplication, chess, voice or face recognition, or what have you isn't the same thing.  AI folks love to conflate such one-off performances by engineers using fast computation with genuine AI, where the latter means "a new kind of intelligence!  A new kind of being!"  But it's all wishful thinking, and sci-fi fuzzies.  Zuckerberg's "Jarvis" is AI, says he.  Sure.  But AI here is just the buzzword for something "cool" (and topical, as deep learning techniques in machine learning research are breaking new ground with image recognition tech).

Anyway, not everyone shares his gee-whiz enthusiasm for automating opening doors or changing room temperature.  Just ask his wife.
