id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_18012"> Yeah it's interesting because a novel like
The Stranger, like so much of existentialism, is actually a commentary about the
loss of God (or Christianity). But everyone is so secular these days that we
find it hard to see the problem (and so we sort of misread the points Camus,
Sartre, Kierkegaard _et al_ were making). </span> </div> <div

id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_17815"> All this started with Nietzsche, who was
among the first of the "great" thinkers of the 19th century to see that the
consolations of Catholicism&mdash;Christendom&mdash;were sweeped away, gone. 
The entire foundation of the Western world was religion, and then in a short
span of a hundred years or so, it wasn't. It was replaced of course with
science, but again, Nietzsche saw that "science" was not really a meaningful
replacement for religion. When he said "God is dead" he was being
prophetic&mdash;he was saying "you people do not even understand the sea changes
that are about to sweep through the Western world." </span> </div> <div

id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_17819" style="font-family: 'times new roman', 'new

id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_17818"> Existentialism was the philosophical
response to nihilism; Kierkegaard was a Christian but thought it was absurd to
be a "believer" and required a subjective, transformative experience that filled
one with anxiety and dread (the "leap of faith",through darkness, into light, as
it were). Sartre was an atheist and coined the phrase "existence precedes
essence." This is, again, is a profoundly religious-inspired statement: we once
got our "essences" from the religious world&mdash;the notion of a soul, a
benevolent Creator, and a universe that had meaning for us personally. Suddenly
there are no essences, as there is no longer "God" to give them to us. So in a
void where nothing can mean anything, isn't existence (that is, without
essences) terrifying and pointless? Who shall we be? And how? Sartre's answer
is that we "create" our essences (his dictum means: we exist first, then we
choose our essence). This all sounds warm and fuzzy today, but I think most of
us don't really think through what he's saying. The freedom we gain once
severed from our religious essences is, according to Sartre, a "radical"
freedom. It's a gut-wrenching realization that every choice you make creates
you (whereas you once had a "blueprint" to work with, so to speak). He would
not understand (or certainly not agree with) our blue-sky attitudes about our
existence. I think it's funny to reflect on existentialism's message in our
modern techno-science world. It's sort of like: who has the time for all this
fear and trembling? Huh? Like Huxley warned us in his Brave New World (an
almost perfect commentary on scientific distopia), we can alienate ourselves
from ourselves with <span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_18014"
style="font-style: italic;"> distractions&mdash; </span> iPhones, money,
Facebook, on and on. The big questions don't go away so much as they never can
quite come up, busy as we are (and doing, really, what?). Existentialists would
say we're guilty of a false consciousness (or in Sartre's words, a "bad faith").
 I get it, but you know, existential angst has it's limits. :) </span> </div>

id="yui_3_7_2_1_1384938147010_18034"> Anyway Camus makes this point well in The
Stranger, and to my point above, note that it is the priest in prison that
brings forth the main character's rage. Not accidental. </span> </div>
