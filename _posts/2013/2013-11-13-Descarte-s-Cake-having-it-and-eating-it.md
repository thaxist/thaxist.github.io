I'm reading Richard Rorty's
Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. Before this I was reading something else,
then something else, then...

I'm generally a fan of
Rorty but here's my take on the whole POC debate and why it never seems to go
anywhere. All the analysis that philosophers of mind have done in the last few
decades is basically accurate. Yes, it's suspicious to talk about mental states
as non-extended in the Cartesian sense, or to talk about them with nouns rather
than adjectives, or even to be dualist about them. (Sure. Yep. Yeah. Got
it.)

I buy the analysis Rorty gives in Mirror,
that Descartes lumped reasoning-about-universals together with sensation (today:
qualia) to make a distinction between extended stuff (for Newtonian mechanics, with primary
qualities that are mathematically describable) and
non-extended stuff, for all the personhood notions we want to
protect. I accept that Descartes thus gave
us the modern mind-body problem, and that this problem didn't really
exist to the classical mind. For example, Aristotle would have a hard time
understanding Descartes' notion of "mind", as he thought that sensation was part
of the body and he had a participatory rather than representational view of
knowing. (And hence, modern philosophy with it's representational framework is
obsessed with epistemology after Descartes, and this is in a real sense an
historic accident due to his idiosyncratic treatment of mind-body issues, a
treatment that was entirely novel and foreign to philosophers of the time.)

The problem is that the
Cartesian mind-body idea (extended versus
non-extended) gives us, also, the modern view of a
material universe: just that "stuff"
which is not-mind and has only those properties that are describable by
mechanics (mathematics). This idea is idiosyncratic and fully a product of
Descartes' error as well; you can't have it both ways. Just as mind is almost
certainly not the "ghost in the machine" idea that we inherited from Descartes,
so too "matter" is almost certainly not only the just-so "stuff" that we can
explain and predict using our differential equations and geometry. (I like
Newton too, but this is really quite a tip of the hat, to cede to him all of
reality.) So the real mind-body problem is the problem of having one's cake and
eating it too. This is the situation the analytic philosophers found themselves
in post-scientific revolution, and while accepting the Cartesian division where
it suited them (as defenders of a "new" and "scientific" materialism), they've
rejected the mind where it doesn't. I give you: our current age. (Or: our
patchwork of almost certainly wrong ideas.)

So this is silly. I'm always amazed at
how smart people get things wrong. I think there's some kind of smart-person
bug or disease, a kind of moral courage that they lack sometimes (Was: cozy up
to religion. Now: cozy up to "science"&mdash;in scare quotes because we still
picture empirical science as exploring the parts of a machine, though </span>
this idea is clearly wrong today.
Another puzzle.). With all those smart analytic
philosopher-scientists-wanna-be's, we're certain to get things all _wrong-o_ .

So, modern reader, I'm with
you. I'd be happy to throw out Descartes. The way I see things I can't figure
out which is this French genius's sillier idea: that all of nature should
correspond just-so to our differential equations (though it, of course, turned
out otherwise), or that all of mind should correspond just-so to what's left
over (so to speak).

In other words, there isn't really any such thing as "matter"
in the Cartesian sense (stripped of everything we can't measure). Why
should there be? Once you see this side of things (or this horn of the
dilemma), you don't waste so much time writing diatribes about Cartesian mind
(those dualists, the idiots!), because you realize it throws the same net over
the materialistic notions you want to preserve.
Stuff-open-to-empirical-investigation has all sorts of properties that would
have flummoxed Newton (and Descartes). "Nature" (rather than Cartesian
"matter") has all sorts of interesting properties. One of them seems to be some
aspects of mind. Spontaneity. And quite obviously, sensation. Right? To put
things another way, what sort of a universe do we really live in?
