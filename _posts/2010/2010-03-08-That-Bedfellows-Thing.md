David Brooks of NYT [compares the Tea Partiers to the 1960s anti-establishment
"New Left".](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/opinion/05brooks.html) His
argument is that the most salient aspect of the Tea Party movement is its
relation to institutional power, to The Man, and in this sense it resembles the
New Left. Common to both movements, he writes, is the assumption that the
common folk are the good guys and that our leaders and institutions are corrupt.
 The solution? Start over, tear it down, get the power back to the people.

Brooks' analysis is certainly not anything approaching comprehensive, but it
seems right to me as far as it
goes.
