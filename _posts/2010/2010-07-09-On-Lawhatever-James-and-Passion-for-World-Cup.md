Labron James makes much ballyhooed anouncement on which organization he will
work for, continuing to bounce a ball on a wood floor and throw it through a
metal hoop to the adoration of millions. Don't Care. Not that I'm bothered by
fame _per se_ . I love Lady Gaga and she's a _fame monster._ 

What other grumbly points can I make. Oh yes, I almost forgot. In the ongoing
attempt for all enlightened Americans to outdo each other in showing the most
self-deprecation, the Bay area is aflame with passion for the World Cup. Who
gives a damn? Uruguay? I don't even know if I pronounced it right, and you know
what, who cares? Uruguay? Yes it's vitally important that we all hang on the
edge of our seats to see this world power at their finest hour (actually I think
they lost). Interestingly, when I show a little American nationalism amongst my
European friends here in Palo Alto, they seem strangely, ironically, to
appreciate it. It's almost like everyone is thinking: "Americans, get some 
_cojones_ ! The world's superpower and your educated elite are tripping over
themselves to appear embarrased by your success, and desperately trying to
convince us that you're okay because you love watching Uruguay kick a ball
around, clapping so loudly you make yourself look silly. We wouldn't do that,
says the French man, smiling. We _love_ France.
Suckers!")
