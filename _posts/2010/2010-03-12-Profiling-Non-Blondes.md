I've gotten comments and been in discussions with people who seem to think that
my "Blonde Jihadist" post argues that profiling is effective. I'd like to
clarify that what I'm arguing is that the case of LaRose does not _establish_ 
that it is ineffective (or that it is effective) to profile. It says nothing
useful about the debate at all, in fact, _contra_ Rachell Maddow's claim that
LaRose _shows_ that profiling is "stupid". It does not, and Maddow should
know better.

That said, profiling might still be stupid. In fact, there's good reason to
believe that ethnic profiling, by itself, _is_ stupid. See for instance this

discussion.
