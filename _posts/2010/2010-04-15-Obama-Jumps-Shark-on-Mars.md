President Obama re-iterated his commitment to the space program today, 
[announcing that he expects Earthlings to reach Mars within his
lifetime](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100415/ap_on_re_us/us_obama_space) .
Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Obama sought to
dispel any skepticism of his support for NASA, and added that not just
astronauts but ordinary Americans, "like tea <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
class="blsp-spelling-error"> partiers </span> ", could soon be shipped to Mars
as part of his new space exploration program.

Gotcha. Really, though. I'm ambivalent about getting crabby about this latest
salvo from Big Idea Obama (because in general I like the space program, and I
like Big Ideas), but nonetheless it seems that we would all do well to observe
some hard to define yet common sense interval between Big Ideas, wouldn't we?
From historical revamping of health care, to reduce the nukes (an issue we've
become accustomed to ignoring, true), to humans on mars, what's next? They're
all darn worthy proposals for discussion, debate, analysis, action. But it'd
feel more grounded, more deliberative and thought through and, well,
presidential, if we had some time to close out discussion on one Big
Idea&mdash;it's benefits, consequences, downsides&mdash;before launching into
the next. But, alas, fat chance for quiet time with Big Ideas, it seems. The
presidency these days is all 'bout hittin' the turbo thrusters (think: the Iraq
War and former President Bush).

Well, anyway. If my political compass is in working order, at least we won't
hear much more than a whimper about "cap and trade" or "global warming" from the
White House. The dire warnings of impending disaster <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected"> emanating </span> from
Gore and other catastrophe types have quite clearly fallen out of favor these
days (ever notice how, once the hysteria goes away, you can't get people to
defend the _original_ thesis anymore? They defend milk toast versions of it,
the kind of discussion that _you_ wanted to have back when everyone was
screeching, but _they_ thought too moderate. Ask a Global Warming proponent to
talk about Global Warming now, and you'll get discussions about pollution, and
reasonable-sounding stuff about how we should get rid of carbon fuels anyway, 
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error"> et </span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error"> cetera </span> . What
happened to _Catastrophe!_ ? It all just kind of gets forgotten, as if there
really wasn't a hysteria in the first place, and we all just move on in a state
of collective amnesia about our cries of imminent doom just two or three years
prior. Ugh.).

Anywho. Mars! Cool.
Next?
