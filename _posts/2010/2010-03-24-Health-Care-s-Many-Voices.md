Katrina vanden Heuvel writing for the Washington Post assures us that the Health
Care bill&mdash;now law&mdash; [is a good
start](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/23/AR2010032301581.html)
, but does not go nearly far enough on the road to government-managed medicine. 
Holman W. Jenkins writing for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) explains why
insurance companies&mdash;supposedly the "evil" players in health care&mdash;are
 [quite happy about
ObamaCare](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703621104575139732486806838.html?mod=rss_Today's_Most_Popular)
(hint: if everyone has to have coverage, there are lots more people to stick
with skyrocketing costs). 

David Brooks writing for the New York Times (NYT) observes, convincingly, that
we're not really wrestling (yet) with [the enormous costs we're incurring as a
country](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/opinion/23brooks1.html) , health care
the latest charge on the card: 

"This country is in the position of a free-spending family careening toward
bankruptcy that at the last moment announced that it was giving a gigantic new
gift to charity. You admire the act of generosity, but you wish they had sold a
few of the Mercedes to pay for it." 

One of my favorites, moderate Tom Friedman, also writing in NYT brushes aside
the partisan "yes we did" (Democrats) and the "OMG, they did?" (Republicans) on
the health care debate in favor of [an interesting discussion about fixing
government](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/opinion/24friedman.html) , making
it work better for all of us. As he puts it, we need a "tea party" for the
middle of the country.

And my opinion? Oh, who knows? It's too early to tell. _Punt_
