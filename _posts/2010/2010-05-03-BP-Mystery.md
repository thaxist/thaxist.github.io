The BP oil spill mystery: why did the blowout preventer fail? No one seems to
know. BP experts inform us that there are multiple safety mechanism in place,
and they _all failed_ . Huh? I'm certainly not qualified to comment on the
technical merits of oil rig safety devices, but the case is interesting because
of its complexity and because of the unlikelihood of multiple safety procedures
collectively failing. This is the sort of complex, high energy accident I was
talking abou in [Systems
Accidents](http://thethaxis.blogspot.com/2010/04/systems-accidents.html) . I'll
be following this story to see how it unfolds. For starters here's [a good
discussion in a
