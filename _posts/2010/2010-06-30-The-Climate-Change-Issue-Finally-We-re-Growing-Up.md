I have some material I'll develop in an upcoming blog on (broadly speaking)
rationality given uncertainty. This got kick-started from an interesting article
from The New Republic about [developing rational strategies to tackle climate
change](http://www.tnr.com/blog/critics/75757/why-the-decision-tackle-climate-change-isn%E2%80%99t-simple-al-gore-says?id=yDhEXIHiCxDgzCs+DgHJRY875T0I3guuYrvt9Kn/4SUMcu33f5l1GpapD3WXaJZt)
 given the uncertainty of our predictions and the very many other risks (and
their uncertainties) that we all face. It's a good read, and strikes a rare
reasonable, non-partisan tone on the topic of climate
change.
