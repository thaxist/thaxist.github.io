This isn't breaking news anymore, but I'm still bitin':

Community activist group [ACORN is
disbanding](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35991176/ns/politics-more_politics/) ,
blaming failure on partisan attacks from the right. This ignores, of course, an
obvious explanation, regarding getting caught on camera giving tax advice to
pimps and prostitutes. Still, where are our priorities? And how prude have we
become? Members of the oldest profession can now expect greater difficulty
getting quality tax tips. Nice job,
catchers-of-ACORN-giving-tax-tips-to-pimps-and-prostitutes. I hope your
high-minded <span style="font-style:italic;"> caught on camera </span> antics
were worth
it.
