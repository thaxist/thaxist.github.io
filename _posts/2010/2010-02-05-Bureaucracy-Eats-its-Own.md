Leave it up to Philip K. Howard, irrepressible lawyer who wrote the book "Life
Without Lawyers", to cut to the chase on the problem with too much bureacracy. 
Here's his response, in WSJ today, to Obama's "We can put America to work today
building the infrastructure of tomorrow" claim in the State of Union speech:

"But America can't build new infrastructure because no one has the authority to
say "go." Nearly endless environmental review, followed by years of litigation
by anyone who doesn't want the project, will make it impossible to put a shovel
in the ground for a new project for years. 

Too much law always causes paralysis. Environmentalists wanted legal power to
stop bad projects, and now find themselves unable to build good projects. Real
people must have responsibility to make these decisionsâ€”that's what government
is for. Cut the environmental review process to a year or two at most."

Right on Phil.
