The Associated Press is reporting that economists believe [the economy will not
continue to pick up
steam](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100326/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/us_economy) :

"Many economists, however, think the economy has slowed in the current quarter
to about half the pace seen at the end of last year."

Why? Last year's growth came from manufacturing, not consumer demand (which
weakened), restocking dwindling inventories from businesses who had let them
lapse in the face of weakened demand for goods.

Like this:

Consumers stop spending &mdash;> businesses stop buying goods &mdash;> 
inventories go down &mdash;> factories occasionally get orders to restock the
shelves &mdash;> small blips in production show up, but don't last (because
consumers haven't started spending yet)

So? Sooo? So the unemployment is at 9.7%, not likely to change much, because
the economy is forecasted to grow at only 2.5 - 3% next year, which isn't enough
to pull us out of the bad effects of the recession. (I suppose the bad news will
breathe new life into Super-Keynesian Paul "Spend, Baby, Spend" Krugman, who
will argue afresh that this proves that the first stimulus wasn't enough.) 

Oh well, on the economic debate goes. As actress Kate Beckinsale once quipped,
"numbers are boring". Well, they are. And scary sometimes,
too.
