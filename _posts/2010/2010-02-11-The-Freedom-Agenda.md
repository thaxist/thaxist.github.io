Fukuyama argues in the WSJ today that the Obama administration has erred in
rejecting the Bush "freedom agenda" of promoting democracy in the Middle East in
favor of a Realpolitik approach that provides support to existing regimes, as a 
_quid pro quo_ for information about terrorists. We've gone back to dealing
with "Arab strongmen", as Fukuyama puts it. Case in point, the $70 million in
security aid the U.S. gave to Yemen, a country ruled by the corrupt regime of
President Saleh, who has squelched democratic reform and installed family
members into his government, which functions in the all-too-familiar
illegitimate authoritarian fashion of many Arab countries in the region.

Though the Bush "freedom agenda" became associated with the unpopular Iraq War,
and sustained further damaged by tying it too closely to the military objectives
of the War on Terror (think: the conspicuous refusal of the Bush administration
to recognize the apparently legitimate Palestinian election of Hamas in 2005),
Fukuyama argues that "the core premises of the Freedom Agenda remain essentially
correct". What the Bush administration sought to accomplish, ultimately, was a
more democratic Middle East, dragged (kicking and screaming, if necessary) into
an embrace of political democracy and individual liberties by a foreign policy
that tied support in the region to verifiable democratic reforms, not just to
information from "Arab strongmen" that may prove helpful for our own short-term
national security interests. The Bush administration got it essentially right,
in other words, because they saw that the threat to the West from the Middle
East cannot be expurgated, and may well fester and grow, as long as the
authoritarian, anti-democracy regimes dominate the region, unchallenged by our
dollars or our
ideas.
