Chris Mathews slipped in a puzzling comment on Hard Ball last night, that he's
in favor of "ObamaCare" because he thinks people should "take responsibility"
for their health care. This is an odd invocation of the concept of
responsibility. Why should being _forced_ to purchase something be thought of
as "taking responsibility"? I have a friend, for example, who's in his
mid-twenties and hasn't been to the doctor in years. He's not happy about adding
another line item for expenditures each month, because frankly put, he's not
worried about getting sick. If he did get sick I suppose he'd pay out of pocket
if it wasn't too serious, or go to the emergency room if it was (I didn't ask,
but I suspect I'd receive these types of responses). In short, he doesn't want
to purchase health care, because he's healthy. He wants to spend his money on
other things (say, giving to the Red Cross for disaster relief, or, okay, buying
nice stuff). He wants to take responsibility for his own purchasing decisions,
you might say.

So this is the point: Mathews' line about purchasers of mandatory insurance
"taking responsibility" is humbug, because the concepts of "responsibility" and
of "coercion" are naturally at odds with each other. When we tell our children
to "take responsibility" say, for cleaning their rooms, we typically mean that
we are tired of reminding them, and that we want them to internalize the value
of it without us threatening them with punishment. Likewise, when my friend
resists spending money on a health plan for himself, on grounds that he's
healthy and wishes his money to be put to other uses, he _is_ taking
responsibility for his health care; he's saying "I'm not interested in making
the purchase at this time", which is making a decision based on his
circumstances and his judgement about his needs. It's therefore silly to claim
that he'll be "taking responsibility" for his healthcare, just as soon as it's
made compulsory. Downright
humbug.
