This certainly qualifies as petty itself, but I'm in "gonzo blogger" mode right
now, typing away at my suddenly indispensible 12" Netbook (it sat unused for
several months while I shunned it in favor of a laptop) in the caffeine-frenzy
of Saturday night at the Barnes and Noble. Free Wi-Fi! The petty part is this.
 A couple of young, high school aged girls have plopped down next to me, and
within seconds they have launched into this string of "ya knows" and "I'm
likes", and "and then he was like", and the obligatory "whaateverrr" (with that
strange California surfer tone that somehow is emitted by all young people, no
matter where they grew up. I'm convinced that there are sixteen year old girls
in Iran right now munching on Persian bran muffins in bookstores and coffee
shops, like-whatevering-it in the exact same prosodic rhythms as their sisters
in the Barnes and Nobles and Starbucks of America's towns and cities).

So I'm finished. Forget plowing through another chapter of "Proust was a
Neuroscientist" for now. There's really no where else to sit, and its
impossible to read with the jackhammer of dunderheaded comments rattling away
beside me. Anyway, in gonzo mode it's fun to people-listen, I tell myself. 
Let's listen! And what do you know, before long my initial despair has
transmogrified into this kind of purient curiosity: how vapid can they get? 
Can Jamie actually manage something so trivial and stupid, that Bergen&mdash;who
is herself dedicated to the trivial and stupid&mdash;actually becomes
self-conscious? Is it possible for the weight of the triviality to collapse on
them both? Or can they really keep what-evering it, indefinitely, cheerfully
oblivious that they are in fact the unwitting subjects of the middle aged gonzo
blogger next to them? How will our story end?

I'm on the case now. Surreptitiously absorbing the latest tale of
"and-then-he-said, and-I-was-like, and-so-he-goes, but-I'm-like". There's a
kind of internal logic to it, really, because exactly why _did_ Heath text
Bergen in class, telling her that he made out with what's-her-name? No kidding
she was like "no", I'm now thinking, because I'm suspecting&mdash;as they are, I
take it&mdash;that Heath's like, you know, he's like, a _jerk_ .

So, I'm in it to win it, now. I hit upon the idea of transitioning from mere
passive observation to posing a question to them. What will they do? Will they
smile? Or laugh? Or look at me in horror? I figure I'll turn to them, and, in
the best older-professional, respectable face I can muster, hit them with
something like: "Hi, excuse me, but I'm writing a book on the decline of
intellectual conversation among America's youth, and I was wondering if you
could just continue in the vein that you've begun, and if you don't mind I'd
like to write about some of your conversation. The chapter that's relevant is
called "The Intolerable Vapidity of Carmen and Laney", a kind of catchy title (I
hope) about how highschool kids drone on and on about the pettiest, most trivial
desiderata...". 

(But, alas, I can't muster it. And it's just as well, I think, because as
quickly as they erased any possibility of reading and thinking, they've wrapped
up about Heath, met up with two more friends, and are up and on to somewhere
else. This leaves me in a comic state of affairs, contemplating the near total
disappearance of my initial bemused aggravation twenty minutes ago, left now
with a slight disappointment in their departure. Me, abandoned to my reading on
Proust and neuroscience, which now seems more effort than fun.) 

So our story nears its end. It suffices to close with a few admittedly cursory
thoughts on "kids today". Kids today, they seem so adroit at juxtaposing this
manifest silliness with busy-body success, achievement. They're like, studying
all the time, and, like, aceing their SATs, too. It's entirely possible that
the Trivial Two who sat next to me will go on to study law or medicine or
English at a respectable college, and end up a few years from now in graduate
school, and land white collar, well-paying jobs, and on and on the American
dream goes. Kids can, like, talk like this, for, like, a long time, and still
end up getting taken seriously later. Onward and upward, for most of them. The
"Achievatron", as David Brooks calls it, just keeps going and going. Many of
these kids, seemingly so vapid, are in fact wired for success. (It's notable
that they were, like, at a bookstore on a Saturday night, after all.) The
Achievatron is much more difficult to stop then anything Heath can muster, and
Heath himself may end up Harvard law. Smart money is: that paper will get
written before class on Monday. And as far as Heath goes, you go girl. Like,
whateverrr about
him.
