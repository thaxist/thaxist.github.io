Today is the [245th anniversary of the Stamp
Act](http://www.transterrestrial.com/?p=25445) , apparently. Which reminds me,
I've been meaning to comment on how, well, American it is to hate taxes. I'm
sure most people "hate taxes" to the extent that folks don't much like money
going out, rather than coming in. But Americans have a rich history of really
hatin' on taxes, from the colonial era onward. George Washington himself wasn't
having the ole' "pay your taxes" spiel by Mother England, and of course the
Stamp Act gave rise to a mob. After ratification of the Constitution, Hamilton
tried an excise tax on frontiersman, taxing mainly their whiskey, which was used
almost as currency at the time. This resulted in armed rebellion, squelched
only by the amassing of some twelve thousand soldiers in response. In short,
Britain found from the get go, sustained and determined resistance to the paying
of taxes. Now, we can debate about whether Americans should rethink this
kneejerk resistance to paying Uncle Sam, but it's no argument that it's as
American as Apple
Pie.
