Does the damn Prius have [a sticky gas pedal, or
not](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100316/ap_on_bi_ge/us_runaway_prius) ? And,
if not, how lame is it to pick on the feel-good Prius? People are driving
around, thinking in self-interested terms about how much money they're saving at
the pump, and in global terms about making the world a better place with smart
technology, and some jerk in San Diego falsely claims that his Prius stormed off
at 94 mph (this seems like good PR, actually: the Prius can do 94 mph?),
conjuring images of a horrific crash, blood smeared across the once-sexy
"Hybrid" decal, its battery hurled into the street, maiming pedestrians caught
unawares, jarred out of their pleasant stroll by the smell of burning tires,
fire, and death. Death! Death by Prius!

Okay, maybe a bit too far. But, again, _does_ the Prius have a sticky gas
pedal, or what? Those hapless execs at Toyota must be close to _seppuku_
.
