Expectations are that the Supreme Court will find in favor of plaintiff in
McDonald v. Chicago, which will effectively apply the Heller decision&mdash;
that the individual has a right to bear arms in relation to the Federal
government&mdash; to the states. In this case, the individual has this right in
relation to his or her state. Proponents of gun rights rightly point out that
this effectively makes gun bans unconstitutional (it does not prohibit, of
course, reasonable restrictions on the sale and use of guns, including certain
types of guns, like so-called "assault weapons").

The Court will likely argue its case using the due process clause of the 14th
Amendment, the clause responsible for transporting much of the Bill of Rights to
the states (also, famously, the non-enumerated "right to privacy", which played
a pivotal rule in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion ruling.)

Likely absent in the upcoming gun rights ruling will be any invocation of
another 14th Amendment clause, prohibiting states from abridging any
"priviledges or immunities" of US citizens, which was argued away from
application to anything but protection of rights when citizens are "on the high
seas" (no joke) by the 1873 Slaughter House rulings, widely thought to be flawed
by liberal and conservative Constitutional scholars alike.

Anyway, it looks like Mr. McDonald will get his handgun for self-defense (he
does live in the South Side of Chicago, after all). For those chagrined about
the ruling, try to remember that the right to keep and bear arms is "right there
in the text", as Justice Scalia pointed out. For those worried that the
Constitution has been getting trampled on in recent years, it would be a strange
state of affairs if this didn't provide some solace, however
small.
