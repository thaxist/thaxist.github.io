Timothy Egan writes in the NYT about the [perplexing reduction in crime in
L.A.,](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/l-a-consequential/?ref=opinion)
with homicides down 80%. Apparently Omaha, Nebraska has a higher murder rate (I
guess this is noteworthy because places like Omaha or Nebraska in general are
supposed to be full of rock solid heartland types driving pickup trucks, giving
strangers stranded on the Interstate a lift to the local diner).

Egan is a bit short on explanation &mdash; he cites several, none of which seem
much more than anecdotes &mdash; but the general idea, it seems, is that the
drug wars are cooling down, and people like the police, and they do a pretty
good job. Well,
okay.
