Bear [mauls hiker in
Kentucky](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100629/ap_on_re_us/us_bear_attack) . 
Says wildlife spokeswoman Barbara Atwood "They had a bear sighting yesterday.
However, they could not confirm that it was the bear in question", adding
hopefully that "...they feel confident the bear is still in the area." Hats off
to anyone who can catch a bear without killing it. But this whole issue of
catching a reprobate animal is a perpetual puzzle to me: how exactly does one
confirm that a particular black bear is <span style="font-style: italic;"> the
</span> bear? Every black bear I've seen looks exactly the same as any other. 
Sighting one amounts to sighting <span style="font-style: italic;"> any </span>
 one. (How might it fit some description? Rumbles about the woods? Wearing
all black?)

So anyway this dubiously perspicacious observation exposes only my complete
ignorance compared to wildlife experts who appear, from the ignorant outside of
things, to be pulling off some sort of nature magic trick. On a related point,
I'm confident that the perp is still in the area,
too.
