Turns out, [the tea party folks are wealthy egg
heads](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html) . Huh? I was
thinking poor, uneducated rowdy Southern types with provincial politics: the 
[Tom Joad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath) response to Obama's
_fancy talk from the big city_ . But, alas, they're not so easy to dismiss, it
seems ("Hey Ma! Can't we still play the racist card, can't we play the race
card!" _True, they can still be racist. They can still be evil._ says a voice,
from nowhere in particular _._ "No one thought that Hitler was missing teeth,
but he's still universally despised", offers Whitfield, a twinkle in his eye. Ma
smiles knowingly, nodding, her stout body stirring the great cauldron of stew.).

I have a hunch&mdash;just a hunch&mdash;that intellectual right-of-center types
like David Brooks, who've been dismissive of the Tea Party movement heretofore,
will take them a bit more seriously after these polls recast the movement in a
more-acceptable light, more acceptable to those (like me) who knee-jerked the
connection between an anti-big government message and white red necks with
farmer's tans and bad attitudes about them folks talkin' change in the big city.
Just a
hunch.
