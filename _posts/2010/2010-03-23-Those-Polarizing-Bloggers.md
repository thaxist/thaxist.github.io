Law professor Cass R. Sunstein argues in Infotopia that blogs tend to create
group polarization, where political views become more radical (so, if you're
conservative and read conservative blogs, you become more so, and so too with
liberal views and liberal blogs). Of course everyone wants to pretend that
their view is just "the reasonable one", but the truth is that having a point of
view will tend to put you somewhere on the political spectrum. Case in point: 
if you believe abortion should be legal&mdash;if you support the Roe ruling, for
instance&mdash;you're almost _ipso facto_ socially liberal, as few if any
social conservatives are pro choice. On the other hand, what makes people so
interesting is that many of us have strange amalgums of liberal and conservative
views. One might, for instance, be pro choice and "pro military", in the sense
that one doesn't support spending reductions in the military, supports the war
in Afghanistan (I guess the war in Iraq was "won", by the standard that the
media doesn't talk about it anymore, leaving it to historians), tough foreign
policy on Iran, and so on. 

Anyway, following Sunstein, we would do well to read [a range of
blogs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/health-care-post-mortem-d_b_508779.html)
 to avoid polarization (which he argues is bad, as one might have guessed, since
it tends to reduce the amount of available information in groups, which means
there's less chance of making an informed
decision).
