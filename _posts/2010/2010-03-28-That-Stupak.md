WSJ reports that Michigan Rep. Bart Stupak, who has been targeted by
antiabortion folks after voting for the health care bill, is now in the
crosshairs of the prochoice camp, furious because he voiced concerns about
abortion funding in the legislation in the first place (translation: even if you
voted for it, Stupak, you _talked_ about not voting for it first, damn you). 
Says Elizabeth Shipp, political director of NARAL Pro-choice America:

"This one's personal. For us and a lot of our members in his district, we're
going to do what we can to make that man leave office and retire."

Love the "that man" thing. But Shipp's threat is worlds better than the
messages Mr. Stupak has been receiving from the antiabortionists, who've
expressed their displeasure with his vote with suggestions that he get diseases,
bleed out of orifices, and die (really). 

Oh, well. Sucks to be you, Mr. Stupak. Perhaps we should modify Lincoln's
famous aphorism about only pleasing some of the people all of the time, or all
of the people some of the time, to something about pleasing no one,
ever.
