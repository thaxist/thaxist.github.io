Even government-mandated health care enthusiasts probably can agree that,
whatever the arguments in favor of universal coverage, it's a stretch to sell
ObamaCare as a program that helps restore fiscal responsibility, and it's
downright loony to claim that [ObamaCare will stave off U.S.
bankruptcy](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100402/ap_on_bi_ge/us_obama_health_care_overhaul)
. (What's next, it'll help capture Osama Bin Laden, too?). I voted for Obama,
but his shameless campaign-mode rhetoric has started to wear thin. Another
reason he's starting to wear thin: in 2008 when he needed to attract voters like
me, he took positions that placed himself in the reasonable-sounding center on
issues, like _opposing government mandated health insurance_ . I'm sure his
about face on this issue makes the left happy, but making the left happy is like
making the right happy, we get the same old stale politics, with the same old
problems. This is why, in 2008, it sounded like change we could believe in for
Obama to support health care reform while resisting shoving it down our throats.
 

Fast forward to 2010, and now it's Big Government Obama (which is change that's
hard for over half of the country to believe in, if we believe the polls). But
Big Government Obama makes Obama a Big Idea guy (even if ObamaCare is a bad
idea, it's a Big Idea). Smart, effective government puts him in the nitty-gritty
weeds month and month, year after year. Big Government Obama grabs the
headlines, and creates a legacy that gets the historians' ink flowing. Oh
well.
