I have no idea whether there's any scientific validity to the research conducted
at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, aka CERN, on whether cosmic
rays affect climate on Earth. What is interesting is the implication in Anne
Jolis's [September 7
article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904537404576554750502443800.html)
 The Other Climate Theory, that researchers have long speculated that not just
C02, but cosmic rays, may indeed change our climate. Where's this debate in the
media? Roger W. Cohen, in a WSJ response to Jolis's article, claims that the
Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) camp&mdash;the scientists who think that the
primary cause of the warming Earth is human activity&mdash;is actually much
smaller than how the media frames the debate, and in fact there is another
school of thought among scientists that non-anthropogenic factors may be driving
changes. In this "contrarian" school of thought, scientists tend to group into
those interested in investigating the influence of cosmic rays, and those
interested in the hypothesis that the Earth naturally and quickly changes
temperature based on its own "unforced chaotic variations". Whatever the merits
of these discussions, why haven't we heard them? That's a question even a
non-atmospheric scientist can
pose.
